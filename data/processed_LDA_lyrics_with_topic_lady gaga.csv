Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah

[Verse 1]
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please (Woo)
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

[Post-Chorus]
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face
(Mum mum mum mah)

[Verse 2]
I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be (Woo)
A little gamblin' is fun when you're with me (I love it, woo)
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun, fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

[Post-Chorus]
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)

[Bridge]
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin', I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous
[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

[Post-Chorus]
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face
(She's got me like nobody)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face

Alejandro,pop,lady gaga,2009,290064,"[Intro]
I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...

[Verse 1]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
[Interlude]
Stop, please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go

[Verse 2]
She's not broken, she's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush

Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch

He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart (Big boy)

[Verse 1]
Look at him, look at me
That boy is bad and honestly
He’s a wolf in disguise
But I can't stop staring in those evil eyes (Evil eyes, evil eyes)

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked my girlfriend if she’d seen you 'round before (Oh yeah)
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor, baby
""We might’ve fucked, not really sure, don’t quite recall (Oh yeah)

He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)
He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

[Verse 2]
He licked his lips
Said to me, ""Girl, you look good enough to eat""
Put his arms around me
Said, “Boy, no, get your paws right off of me”

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you 'round before (Oh yeah)

He ate my heart, he ate my heart

I wanna just dance, but he took me home instead
Uh-oh, there was a monster in my bed
We french kissed on a subway train
He tore my clothes right off
He ate my heart and then he ate my brain

Dance in the Dark,pop,lady gaga,2009,100266,"[Intro]
(Make it stop!)
Silicone, saline, poison, inject me
Baby, I’m a free bitch
I’m a free bitch

[Verse 1]
Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won’t walk away, but she won’t look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess
(Tell 'em, girls)

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
(Saline)
[Verse 2]
Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she’s howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she’s a tramp
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still does her dance
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still kills the dance
(Tell 'em, girls)

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blonde (Jon) Benet Ramsey
We’ll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart Diana, you’re still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together, we’ll dance in the dark

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa

[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm dressed cool, my parents put up a fight
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And if I'm a hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And in the morning, I'm short of my identity
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I scream, ""Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I wanna be?""
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
To be

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair

[Chorus]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair

Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
As free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
A chance (No)

I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know

I just wanna be free, I just wanna be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair
It's all the glory that I bare

Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh

[Verse 1]
I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up
You gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans
With your long hair and your cigarette stained lies

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

[Chorus]
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
[Verse 2]
I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams
Bubble dreams
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know that it's so complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts of all my wrecked up friends

[Chorus]
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless so speechless
I'll never love again
Oh, friend, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Refrain]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh
[Bridge]
And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up? Could I give it all up for you?
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up, if I promise, boy, to you?
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again (Ahh)

[Chorus 2]
So speechless (Ahh)
You left me speechless, so speechless
Will you ever talk again?
Oh, boy, why you so speechless? (Speechless, baby)
You've left me speechless, so speechless

Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene

Got no flights outta here
Got no TV shows until next year
No, I got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Baby, you’re my liquor
I’m addicted to you
So I’ll just be stuck on, stuck on fucking you
Stuck on fucking you

I don’t ever want just another boy or a girl to love

Got all night, no cameras
We've got no champagne but we've got drugs

Purple sheets, cymbal clock
Going to spend my time rocking on top
Yea, I got nothing to do

Love it when my man smells so good

Don’t forget me baby
Don’t forget me when I leave and go on tour
'Cause I know your life would be a snore
You’d be all stuck fucking this hooker-whore

Got no nothing
You’re in the next room
You fell asleep on my tour bus while me and Fernando and Paul and Justin and Dave are making music
But I miss you

And we're drinking warm champagne
But we don’t care cause we’re in Minnesota

Midnight rush with a pen in my hand
Inkin' Lincoln, sanskrit with a fan

A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man

Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Won't sign away my life to

Won't sign no monkey papers

Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart

'Til your diamond words melted into some ice

Groove, slam, work it back
Space Cowboy, just play that track
Gaga in the room
So starstruck, Cherry-Cherry-Cherry Cherry Boom Boom

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Styling out to the beat that you're freakin'
Fantasize I'm the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Cue me up, I'm the 12 on your table
I'm so starstruck

Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up, blow my heart up
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Baby, now that we're alone, gotta request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?
Got your Dre headphones with the left side on
Wanna scratch me back and forth, back and forth? Uh-huh
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Get the breakdown first
Up until the chorus to the verse, re-ke-re-ke-reverse

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey, little mama like ""Really, really, is that him?""
I done seen you before, what you got on them big rims?
Enter that cash flow, I'm like, baby, you don't trip
So shawty, say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I shoulda had an overdose, too many Starbucks
Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunners who let the top back on the Chevy Impala
Hummers and all that, fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars?
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after
[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Space Cowboy]
I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so, so starstruck

Princess Die,pop,lady gaga,2012,29932,"[Verse 1]
Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself

[Refrain]
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

[Verse 2]
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel, but was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Volumes I know will love and save me from myself
[Refrain]
Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

[Bridge]
Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
We want to watch her cry
Princess die

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

[Post-Chorus]
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold
With the paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down
Oh, it's not that deep
So bob your head for another dead blonde whose real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep
[Outro]

Dirty Ice Cream,pop,lady gaga,2006,2807,"[Verse 1]
It's too much a mess and a stress to figure out
And too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical

[Pre-Chorus]
But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

[Chorus]
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

I can't live with you, yes it's true
Or live without the kind of guy that I'm about
You kiss me like a rockstar
And you always wanna hold my hand

Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See (see), when you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the aggro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris, cold
J'veux pas mourir toute seule

Above my head, head, head

This time I'm not leaving without you

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,""

And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me ""Heart of Gold""
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I’m not leaving without you

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,""
There’s...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(There's something), something about this place
(Something), something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
C'mon! Put your drinks up!
[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ
There's...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(Something), something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about
Just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up, for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya

[Final Chorus: Lady Gaga & Brian May]
You and I
You, you and I
Baby, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

The fame and riches earned
With you, I'd watch them all be burned
Woah, woah

Bad Kids,pop,lady gaga,2011,41936,"[Intro]
We don't care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom

[Verse 1]
I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
'Til they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)
[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

[Verse 2]
I'm a twit
Degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face, I'm absurd
I'm so bad
And I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)

Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

I'm not that typical baby
I'm a bad kid like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that ""cool and you hate me""
I'm a bad kid, that's the way that they made me
I'm a bad kid, I'm disastrous
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
One of the bad kids don't know wrong from right

Don't be insecure if your heart is pure

From everybody that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
""There she goes, that crazy girl...
She thinks she's something in this world.""
So I'mma close my ears and dream 'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
Yeah, you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again, uh-uh-uh-oh
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop, be sure that I'll say ""go""
To the stars and land
Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me, my strong mean
Hey
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

I can't remember when you looked at me and cried
Said something broke inside of you

I know you'll look for me one day

Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow

With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

And a little bit shy, but I decided that this song is just too short
It's such a beautiful Christmas song, but it's only one verse
So I added one extra one, here it goes

With a carrot nose and charcoal eyes
Oh, and when he cries, I'm gonna tell him it's okay
Because Santa's on his sleigh and he's on his way

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said: ""'Cause he made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say""

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby

If he's the moon, then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar, yeah
When I get to him, run him over with my rocket ship

All our chemistries and our situations
Working out our sex equations

When my hair is blond but my heart's brunette

A synthetic, plastic, rubber man

And I'm stuck in his metal rubber eyes
Rubber eyes

No Way,pop,lady gaga,2013,5107,"[Intro]
(Happy Ending...)

[Verse 1]
I saw a shadow, and I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her, I know that you were intertwined
Even though her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else, and you were both to blame

[Verse 2]
Don't say a word
I'm sure that it won't be enough to erase what I know
Just happens now, what dreams are made of
This is my house, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay
[Verse 3]
Thought that I saw something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought that there's no way you would do that to me
And then last week, when you went aside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold

[Verse 4]
And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare
'Cause when I have those, it isn't real like this one is
This is my heart, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

All the girls, they like their presents like their presents
When boys wrap them up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive if they're well thought out
Sexed up, wrapped right
Every time, get in line, and give me mine
We like black, white, big, striped, polka-dotted, cafe-lotted
Presents come in many sizes
Wrap them up in ribbons

Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons
Silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons!
If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night
We like black, white, big, striped, famous, super-sized ribbons
Don't care what you put inside them
Wrap it all in ribbons
It's the lifestyle that I like
I'll give you yours, you give me mine
But don't forget to wrap them up in pretty, pretty ribbons

Second Time Around,pop,lady gaga,2013,6351,"[Intro]
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Last time I thought we had this talk
Boy, you were getting ready to leave
I thought, baby, you were done
'Cause for a while, you could barely look at me
This time, I thought that we'd be fine
That I'd forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words
But baby, you can not forget the past (Oh, oh babe)
Cannot forget the past (Oh, oh)
Still, baby...

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
The second time around
[Verse 2]
We tried going back to Joe's
That always was our favorite place
Long rides, baby, by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed?
Last time, we were hangin' out
You were acting kind of estranged
Now it's the second time around
I'm sorry, now it's me that feels this way
(My heart just keeps on turning)
It's me that feels this way, babe (Oh, oh babe)
And now you are the one that is hurting

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
[Bridge]
I'm not sure the best way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more, babe
This ferris wheel's got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us, baby
Not meant for us, baby
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around

B-by the shore
With a body like that and your stonewashed eyes
I want you more

I said, ""Mother, mother, mother's for babies, call me kitty.""

With your Van Halen pin and your dark side burns
I want you more

Keep it comin', I'm comin' around like your friend now

I don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine (Shine)
Tried to kick it, just can't find the time

Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake

We know how to make that money

Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
And I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by givin' money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe of a legacy of takin' her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista be goin' in warp speed, breakin' atoms
Blowin' O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me, now I got her
Because she be ready to party and then move to the club (Yes)
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talkin' about jewels and drugs
[Outro: Lady Gaga]

I wanna dress you up in silk
Taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt
What's your size?
This purse can hold my black card
And tiara
Versace promises I will
Dolce Vita

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?
[Chorus]
Donatella!
(I’m smoking 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-Mi-Bella
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day
(I’m the pearl to your oyster, I’m a babe)
I’m gonna smoke Marlboro Lights and drink Champagne
(I smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne)

[Post-Chorus]
Donatella!
'Cause she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she’s misunderstood
Voodoo, voodoo
Voo-don-na-na

[Verse 2]
Walk down the runway, but don’t puke
It’s okay
You just had a salad today
Boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice
Before you...
Get a spray tan on holiday
In Taipei
[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
""'Cause I'm a wandering man,"" he said to me
""And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense
When I got the whole world in front of me?""
So, I said...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
""Baby, why do we love each other?""
I said, ""Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother.""

[Chorus]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)

Brooklyn Nights,pop,lady gaga,2014,17901,"[Verse 1]
I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those Brooklyn nights set us free
I always thought even though
We were so young, we could grow
Up in the end, it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Verse 2]
I missed our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russians scored?
I love Briggite Nielsen's hair
I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open the last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free
[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Bridge]
I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the walk up we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there, I wanna make it work (Make it work)
I didn't brush my hair and my lashes are falling off
Of seven years of our bad luck dating
I want our last night there, a Brooklyn night affair
A Brooklyn night affair

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Outro]
It's not that I don't wanna love you 'cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'll both tell the truth

Lush Life,pop,lady gaga,2014,9421,"[Hook]
I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingué traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clocktails

Then you came along with your siren's song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your pointed smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong
[Bridge]
Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so assured
Now life is awful again
And the thoughtful of heart
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too",en,"i used to visit all the very gay places those come what may places where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life to get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails the girls i knew had sad and sullen gray faces with distingué traces that used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away by too many through the day twelve o'clocktails then you came along with your siren's song to tempt me to madness i thought for a while that your pointed smile was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me ah , yes , i was wrong again i was wrong  life is lonely again and only last year everything seemed so assured now life is awful again and the thoughtful of heart could only be a bore a week in paris will ease the bite of it all i care is to smile in spite of it i'll forget you i will and yet you are still burning inside my brain romance is mush stifling those who strive i'll live a lush life in some small dive and there i'll be while i rot with the rest of those whose lives are lonely too","['visit', 'gay', 'places', 'come', 'places', 'relaxes', 'axis', 'wheel', 'life', 'feel', 'life', 'jazz', 'cocktails', 'girls', 'knew', 'sad', 'sullen', 'gray', 'faces', 'distingué', 'traces', 'washed', 'away', 'day', 'came', 'siren', 'song', 'tempt', 'madness', 'thought', 'pointed', 'smile', 'tinged', 'sadness', 'great', 'love', 'ah', 'yes', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'life', 'lonely', 'year', 'assured', 'life', 'awful', 'thoughtful', 'heart', 'bore', 'week', 'paris', 'ease', 'bite', 'care', 'smile', 'spite', 'forget', 'burning', 'inside', 'brain', 'romance', 'mush', 'stifling', 'strive', 'live', 'lush', 'life', 'small', 'dive', 'rot', 'rest', 'lives', 'lonely']",4,Love and Relationships

Marry The Night - The Prelude Pathétique: Music Video Intro Speech,pop,lady gaga,2011,36274,"""The Prelude Pathétique""- First Part:
When I look back on my life it’s not that I don’t want to see things exactly as they happened, it’s just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way. And truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because I invented it. Clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It’s not that I have been dishonest; it’s just that I loathe reality

For example those nurses, they're wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I. And the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti. I tipped their gause caps to the side like Parisian berets because I think it's romantic, and I also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring

Check out this nurse on the right; she's got a great ass. Bam

The truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears

""The Prelude Pathétique""- Last Part:
You may say ""I lost everything"". But I still had my Be-Dazzler. And I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimming. So I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do; I did it all over again",en,"""the prelude pathétique""- first part: when i look back on my life it’s not that i don’t want to see things exactly as they happened , it’s just that i prefer to remember them in an artistic way . and truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because i invented it . clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer . memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics . they can be lost forever . it’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting i must fill in all the ugly holes , and make it beautiful again . it’s not that i have been dishonest ; it’s just that i loathe reality for example those nurses , they're wearing next season calvin klein and so am i . and the shoes custom giuseppe zanotti . i tipped their gause caps to the side like parisian berets because i think it's romantic , and i also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring check out this nurse on the right ; she's got a great ass . bam the truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair . and that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago , they only gave her the gummy bears . i'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears ""the prelude pathétique""- last part: you may say ""i lost everything"" . but i still had my be-dazzler . and i had a lot of patches , shiny ones from m&j trimming . so i wreaked havoc on some old denim . and i did what any girl would do ; i did it all over again","['prelude', 'look', 'life', 'want', 'things', 'exactly', 'happened', 'prefer', 'remember', 'artistic', 'way', 'truthfully', 'lie', 'honest', 'invented', 'clinical', 'psychology', 'tells', 'arguably', 'trauma', 'ultimate', 'killer', 'memories', 'recycled', 'like', 'atoms', 'particles', 'quantum', 'physics', 'lost', 'forever', 'sort', 'like', 'past', 'unfinished', 'painting', 'artist', 'painting', 'fill', 'ugly', 'holes', 'beautiful', 'dishonest', 'loathe', 'reality', 'example', 'nurses', 'wearing', 'season', 'calvin', 'klein', 'shoes', 'custom', 'giuseppe', 'zanotti', 'tipped', 'gause', 'caps', 'like', 'parisian', 'berets', 'think', 'romantic', 'think', 'mint', 'big', 'fashion', 'spring', 'check', 'nurse', 'right', 'got', 'great', 'ass', 'bam', 'truth', 'clinic', 'wore', 'funny', 'hats', 'blood', 'hair', 'girl', 'left', 'ordered', 'gummy', 'bears', 'knife', 'couple', 'hours', 'ago', 'gave', 'gummy', 'bears', 'wish', 'given', 'gummy', 'bears', 'prelude', 'lost', 'dazzler', 'lot', 'patches', 'shiny', 'ones', 'trimming', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'old', 'denim', 'girl']",1,Love and Relationships
Evry Time We Say Goodbye,pop,lady gaga,2014,6471,"[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
We love each other so deeply
That I ask you, the sweetheart
Why should we quarrel ever
Why can't we be enough clever, never to part

Every time we say goodbye I die a little
Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor

Your Song,pop,lady gaga,2018,27761,"[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions on a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
[Verse 4]
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

Born This Way The Country Road Version,pop,lady gaga,2011,5032,"[Intro]
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
""We are all born superstars""
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause He made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say""

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby

[Interlude]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vuole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way

No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life

Yeah, you can see clearly that I am the one you want
But I must admit that I'm everything you're not

Viva la Vida,pop,lady gaga,2015,3734,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
My missionaries hidin' in foreign trenches

Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Like just The Doors' Love Her Madly and let her in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my blonde head on a silver plate
Just a GaGa on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be queen?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth

For some reason that I can't explain
I know Yves Saint Laurent, no, he won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
The fame won't change us if we don't let it

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Mary won't call my name

The Manifesto of Mother Monster,pop,lady gaga,2011,7964,"[Spoken Monologue]
This is The Manifesto of Mother Monster
On G.O.A.T, a Government Owned Alien Territory in space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite, it was infinite
As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bears no prejudice, no judgment
But boundless freedom
But on that same day, as the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place... the birth of evil
And as she herself split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of choice began its dance
It seems easy, you imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered, ""How can I protect something so perfect without evil?""",en,"this is the manifesto of mother monster on g . o . a . t , a government owned alien territory in space a birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place but the birth was not finite , it was infinite as the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began it was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal , it is eternal and thus began the beginning of the new race a race within the race of humanity a race which bears no prejudice , no judgment but boundless freedom but on that same day , as the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse another more terrifying birth took place . . . the birth of evil and as she herself split into two , rotating in agony between two ultimate forces the pendulum of choice began its dance it seems easy , you imagine to gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good but she wondered , ""how can i protect something so perfect without evil ?

[Verse 1]
I never was the kind of girl that's
Naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
I was insecure
Insecure
But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no
I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no

You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that

But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad

Oh, and he's no accessory to me
-Ry to me, no, no, no!

We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous
Holding on to love
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst
A life without the lips we've kissed, and losing all control

We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness

We're so in love with it
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go
But the poets and the fathers of our time
Put down their weapons in their arms, and know what they must do

You know, ah
Ha

6 inch, high heel
Ostrich, platform
Mary Jane, thirty-seven
Red flame (Yes girls, pump it)
Now walk, now walk, now walk
I wanna see you pump it
Now walk, now walk, now walk
(Ha, don't be mad 'cause they always said you'd free-fall)
I wanna see you pump it

[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
Pump it bitch, to the haters a verse
6 inch, lizard skin, alligator, the purse
Shoe game six, six, and steipers and Birks
I like it, I perch
Vixon and viper the first
Viper the first
You like two and a third
Like who is this bird
You like who in the fur
You heard it a her
Little heffa in the flat 10 dollar skirt
Bitch, never spit the stack on the frock of the purse
The buzz of the block, why nah-nah be the word
The stock of the hills
Spit fire flame for real
When I vamp down the catwalk, I pump it for real
Liquorice lipstick, candy coated, the deal
[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Azealia Banks]
Patent leather
6 inch high heel
Ostrich, platform

I wanna see you pump it

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Pump this, promote this
I know you notice this skill
Notice these high boots plus the focus could kill
Beauty Bambi, young, determined and willed
No previews, baby, it's only premieres

[Bridge: Azealia Banks]
I don't, I don't kn-know what you want
But I know, kn-know that you don't want
None, no you don't want none of me
No, not today
Not today, boy, don't misbehave
Ok, ok
[Verse 3: Azealia Banks]
'Cause it's little A-B, Lady G-A-G-A
Tell your little DJ, better hit that replay
Listen up my nigga when I'm sipping Clicquot
Lemme hit that weed, hey, lemme feel that freak-ay
Finna pop a pill and get that feeling she chased
When I dip and plié
Gimme, gimme leeway
Bitches on my rhythm, off that Heem and he say
He remember me-ay
He remember me-member me

Stuck in the middle zone

Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show

Tap down those boots while I beat around

I close my eyes
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize

Swirl around as if I'm someone else

Pretend that I am you until it clicks

Just Another Day,pop,lady gaga,2016,76469,"[Intro]
Yeah man, play that New York drum, Homer
Show 'em how we do it
Downtown

[Verse 1]
Just another way to prove
I love you, when it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad, I'll turn away
I'll turn away
I'll turn away

[Pre-Chorus]
And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyish thoughts

[Chorus]
We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey I love you
And after all it's just another day
[Verse 2]
Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

[Pre-Chorus]
And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

And after all it's just another day

Come on, Mark!

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons

If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still

But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons

About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh

Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone, phone

Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight

Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You make me feel so pretty
When I'm not feeling so cool today
Yeah, you pull me out when you know that I'm afraid
Something about you
It dries up every tear in my way
And when I trip myself on the sidewalk
You put my boots back on me, babe
'Cause you're my cowboy, you're my everything
And you know how to get me

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm feeling up
Sometimes I'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes I'm moving fast
Sometimes I'm slow
You know, what'll make me go
Sometimes I am the happy girl  you love
Sometimes I don't feel good enough
Sometimes
Sometimes
Oh, you're there when I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
When I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I ask myself these questions
About you that I cannot explain
How you ride with me when you know that I'm to blame
You've proved your love
I don't need to hear the words that you say
But I know you say them anyway
Just to keep me feeling sane
And my worries become yesterday
Baby, you get me

Sometimes I'm feeling up
Sometimes I'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes I'm moving fast
Sometimes I'm slow

Sometimes I think I should settle down or that we could just be friends

But then we, we kissed all night as his mission beach party
And I said

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

I'm packing bags and making stacks
Like a good old time American
And I'm just tryna show my mom and dad
There's such thing as a real good man
Cause when he talks to me, you see the man that you're talking about as I see
When he puts my hand over his bathing suit
Says to me...

Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight

And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Doesn't matter if your daddy gets pissed
It's you and me

Left him in the trunk on highway 10
Put the knife under the hood

I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?

Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?

Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

Get a lotta views 'cause they know we be the top
Jean Basquiat's in the middle of our hall
Ooh, she's my work of art so I pin her to the wall (haha)
Sex in the dark, underneath the waterfall
High as a space cadet as I'm leapin' over stars
Enemy of the state, they got a target on your boy

'Cause I'm the hottest 'cross the board
Cruise through the ghetto, Mulsanne made of metal
Hangin' out the window, Bruce Willis on the pedal
Pool on the roof, black bottle for a model
I gotta keep it fly
Mosquito doors on the auto

I know a girl girl, he'd like to twirl twirl
The kind of girl who loves him and complete his world world

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause He made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up, girl, and you you'll go far
Listen to me when I say""

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby

Running 'round with no clothes on
Heels in the ground
Almost famous on the scene
She looks like a celebrity

Ain't no way her waist that tiny
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

One lost lady and the radio creep
Got your hands in my pockets while you spinnin' the beat
The vinyl spins fast while we trippin' on that

One trick bunny and a haunting man
Got lost in the woods with a gun in the hand
She said ''hey love child, take me back''
I said ''we can't stand still""

Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names

Heard a story 'bout the medicine man
Drove straight to the coast in his minivan
He learned the ways of the local dudes
He said ''I can't stand still""
Missy Brown went to pristine high
Met the medicine man for a token around
She said ''It's been so long since we got down''
He said ''I can't stand still''

Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered,pop,lady gaga,2014,997,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy I'm awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink

But I'm wild again, beguiled again
Simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I could not sleep and wouldn't sleep
Till love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Oh I lost my heart, but what of it?
He is cold I agree
They can laugh, but I love him
And so the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long for the day when I cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Oh!
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot
But now I'm sweet seventeen a lot

Ooouuu ooou oou
Oh

[Verse 2]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love

[Bridge]
I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu
[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

Some girls won’t dance to the beat of the track
She won’t walk away, but she won’t look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she’s a mess
She’s a mess, she’s a mess
Now the girl is stressed

[Verse 2]
Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she’s howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she’s a tramp
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still does her dance
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still kills the dance

Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
The Sun is gone, babe, no more warm days
It's kind of crazy when I think of some of our memories
Taking trips with you when we needed time
Thought I was busy but I'm not having you in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
We were closer than ever (Ever)
You were as sexy as the day that I met you (I met you, yeah)
We were closer than ever (Ever)
I used to think that we'd always be together, and then the weather

[Chorus]
I swear the thunder came and brought the rain
Then the lightning struck, babe, we were never the same
(Never the same)
I should've seen the signs way in the sky
But I was blind, now I realise
[Post-Chorus]
You brought the weather, man
You are my weather man
You brought the weather, man
Tell me the weather, man

[Verse 2]
Boy, you brought the storm, you were doing me wrong
And now I'm sitting in the rain writing you this song
Colder than the frost, girl, you left me lost
Tryna live my life, how I'm supposed to turn this off?

Ill Never Love Again Film Version,pop,lady gaga,2018,172288,"[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew it would be the last time
I would have broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Oh, oh, oh
Oh

When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that it's not true oh baby that you're gone
Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin' and I'm not movin' on

Don't want to start another fire

Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love

Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here
(It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here
(It was kind of trashy)
’Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my sex dreams

We could be caught
(I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
(’Cause I'm broken)
Let's white
(By the one before)
Glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here
(And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

I was naked, boy so were you
When we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
Sine in the times to the cry of a 1000 doves

Do What U Want DJ White Shadow Remix,pop,lady gaga,2014,390,"[Intro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want
Do what you want

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I, I feel good
I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and, you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights (yeah)
Tom Ford, private flights (yeah)
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life
(But let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup (cup)
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want (want)
You wanna escape (oh)
All of the crazy shit (let go)
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president, -ent
And I love to hear you sing, girl

And we layin’ the cut like we don't give a fuck
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and, you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body

After the show, it's the afterparty
It must be the remix, yeah
After the show, it's the afterparty
It's the afterparty
Gotta be the remix, yeah

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body, and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (with your body)
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still

To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons

It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

Give me a million reasons

The Edge of Glory Live,pop,lady gaga,2011,1136,"[Spoken Intro]
This next song is called ""The Edge of Glory"", and I really wanted to play it for everyone tonight because it's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, and I wrote this song about him. So, here it is, this is ""The Edge of Glory""
So grandma, if you're watching at home, this song's for you

[Verse 1]
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
[Break: Spoken]
One of my favorite memories with my grandpa and my grandma right around Thanksgiving, and it's actually leading up to Christmas time, is that they make these cookies called pizzelle's. If you're Italian, you know what those are. They're like really flat waffles, but they're really thin and crisp. My grandpa would always make the pizzelle and would always work the machine, and everybody had to ""I got it, outta the way, outta the way, outta the way"". That was my grandfathers thing, he made the pizzelle's, so I don't know why, but right now, I'm just thinking about the Italian cookies

[Verse 2]
Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)
Put on your shades, I know your dancin' the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Oh, it isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment
Baby, with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory

Need that picture of you, it's so magical

But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights

Fame
Doin' it for the fame
'Cause we wanna (La, la la la)
The rich and famous

[Verse 1]
I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something, I wanna be retro glamour
Hollywood, yes, we live for the...

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby?
A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame

[Verse 2]
I can see myself in the movies, with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind
And whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide
All we care about is pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something
I wanna see television, and hot blondes in odd positions

[Chorus]

Now you won't stop calling me
You should've made some plans with me

Stop, stop, stop...

But what we do have in common is our ideas about love. Our ideas about equality, acceptance, compassion, tolerance. And tonight we come together in the spirit of ARTPOP and f* creative freedom!
How many people.. qui est une artiste ? -look around-
You do not need a contract to be an artist, you do not need a manager to be an artist, You do not need an agency or money to be an artist, all you need is F* CANVAS AND A PAINTBRUSH. Tonight celebrate your wild mind, your passion.. hold on to that glimmer of hope inside of you that lxves to create, and spread lxve with every invention that you make, La France... For those of you who know and lxve ARTPOP, welcome, this is the ultimate experience -smiles-. And for those of you who just came to hear the hits, you must not know me very well.. I suggest then you grab a glowstick and a little monster, and maybe a f. drink or GCT THE F* OCT HERE IT’S MXNICURE!

I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please *jump to right*
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby, stay with me I love it
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been h*, I'll play the one that's on his heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh
HI-YA-AH !

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him h*, show him what I've got, Move it !

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
NOW SCREAAM PARIS !

[Bridge]
I won't tell you that I lcve you
K. or hcg you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my mcffin
I'm not lying, I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvclous!

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face. *dances*

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Talking ’bout diplomatic
I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
We're PARTYNAUSE..S

-Paparazzi-

[Verse 1]
We are the crowd!
We're c-coming out!
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical!
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, bcby, I...
[Chorus]
I’m your biggest fan *raises arms*
I’ll follow you until you lcve me

Bcby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you lcve me
Papa-paparazzi! *walk at every drop*

[Verse 2]
I’ll be your girl backstage at your show!
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets!
Eyeliner and cigcrettes
Shcdow is burnt
Yellow dance and we turn
My lcshes are dry
Purple teardrops, I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, bcby, I...

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan *get off hat and dress*

I, I feel good, I walk alone!
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay!
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body!

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind!
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body!
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life *shake hair*
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party Yeah, yeah! *shake body*

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and Help me now
You won't use my mind

Cork's off, it's on

God, forgive my sins..*looks down*
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die! *hold notes*

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you..!
Might not awake without you..!
Been hurting low from living high for so long!
I'm sorry, and I lxve you
Stay with me, ""Bell Bottom Blue""..

[Post-Chorus]
I need you more than dxpe
I need you more than dxpe
I need you more than dxpe
I need you more than dx-pe..

[Verse 2]
Toast, one last puff.. and two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold..
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day, I cry..!
Oh, I feel so low from living high! *closes eyes*

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you!
Might not awake without you!
Been hurting low from living high for so long! *hold notes*
I'm sorry, and I lxve you..
Stay with me, ""Bell Bottom Blue""
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more you know..

We need you more than dxpe..

So I heard there was a rally here a couple weeks ago
I heard that a million very right wing conservative people spoke out against gay marriage in France
F those F people
Those people do not represent the true perspective of this country. They are extremely conservative, extremely right-wing, and all that we have to do, all that you have to do is be louder than them
Because you are on the right side of history, you are on the side of love, the side of acceptance, the side of tolerance
So don’t you let them bring you down, don’t you let them think they’re setting you back ‘cause they’re not, they’re just a F bunch of winey b*s
I don’t mean that as fighting words but, you know, it’s 2014 and people are getting together
[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We're all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause He made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up, la France you'll go far
Listen to me when I say""!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital ""H""im
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this friends and
Mi amore vole fe yah! yeah-ah!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes!
I'm on the right track, baby
*point mic*
Don't hide yourself
*point mic*
*plays*

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way!
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way

[Pause]
So, if you are living in France, whether you’re young, or old, or in the middle, if you’re gay, hold your head up high and be F proud and live your life
And if anybody here feels uncomfortable with this conversation you probably shouldn’t have come to this concert. Here we spread love with every invention that we make. You don’t have to feel invisible, you don’t have to feel like you don’t matter

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life! *hold notes*
Your on the right track, baby
You are born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige

The Edge of Glory/Judas/Aura/Sexxx Dreams/Mary Jane Holland/Alejandro artRAVE paris version,pop,lady gaga,2014,165,"I'm on the edge of glory

The edge, the edge, The Edgeee ! Yah !

-Judas-

Ah ah. Sh's about to get evil, JUDAAAAAASS!
PUT YOUR HANDS UP! LEVEZ VOUS LA FRANCE! LEVEZ VOUS! LET'S FUCK SHOUT! COME ON!

[Verse 1]
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown
[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It’s so cruel, but I’m still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It’s so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby

PUT YOUR HANDS UP! JUMP OFF THE TRUNK! GO!

[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice..
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face!
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, clap your hands..
BEHIND THE BURQAA!!!
NOW JUMP! RAVEE!!! YEEEAHHH!!!

-Sexxx Dreams-

Gimme a beat Spanky
At the artrave, nothing is what it seems
So I close my eyes, I think about you
And I have the Sexxx Dreams, the Sexxx Dreams
Ah, ha, ha
[Verse 1]
Our lovers' quarrel
Hurts more than I can say
All night
Help me here!
Help me here!

'Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Making love in my Sexxx Dreams

[Bridge]
You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Spoken Interlude]
Is anybody drunk yet? C'MON!
Put your hands up!

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Making love in my Sexxx Dreams

-Mary Jane Holland-

Grab your drinks and spark it world. Let's relax, shall we?
Hands in the air! Let's party!

[Verse 1]
Lady of the 'Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular
She won't, she won't
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight
I will, I will

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me Mary Jane Holland tonight
[Post-Chorus]
Mary Jane Holland!
Mary Jane Holland!

Oh Paris, I know my mom and that think I'm a mess…
But it's alright, because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flames and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentleman, Mary Jane Holland

INTRODUCING, LE PARISIEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MARY, JANE,  HOLLAND!
HANDS UP MOTHERFUCKERS

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane Holland tonight

I THINK WE, I THINK WE, I THINK WE!!

Oh, IN. Oh, OH…

-Alejandro-

Ohh, uuh, yeeah baby… Oh I feel much better… more relaxed… ohh, the grass is very green in paris…,... yeh, oh i just feel even lighter, and maybe I…
I know that we are young and I know that you may love me, but I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro

Oh-oh-oh-oohooh…
I'm free with you, GET OUT OF HERE!

[Verse 1]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you!
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you!

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you boy!
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Hands up Paris !

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando

-Applause-

People ask me if the fame makes me lonely. And I tell them, No, I’m not lonely. Because when I meet my hotel room by myself I can still hear you cheering me there when I close my eyes
When I wrote this album, I wanted to create something full of joy. A celebration, something that took all my mess and all my pain and turned it into the most beautiful schizophrenic psychedelic dance. Full of color, loud electronic music
The most outrageous fashion, something nearly impossible to follow, like my heart, like my mind
Something I couldn’t keep control of
Sometimes we constantly run away from ourselves to keep up with the universe. But with this album I felt free
And if you love ARTPOP then you have no idea how we are so similar
Thank you
So, as much as I enjoy performing this show, laughs Are you saying something?
*gets on her knees* Hello! Oh, my hair! *gets up*
I enjoy performing this show for you every night and I hope that you loved it
Everybody watching on Yahoo, we love you. Everybody here in Paris, we love you
But I’d wish to tell you something. I know we’ve put up a show, and, I have the most amazing dancers, the most amazing band, the most incredible crew. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to the entire crew for this whole tour, I lcve you so much. But, the real show

The real show every night is the one in the audience. You are so full of passion, so full of freedom
So please, my sweet little monsters, in the most non-traditional of request, I the performer, ask you to accept our deepest applause *smiles*

[Intro]
You were spectacular! A masterpiece Paris! I couldn’t take my eyes of you for a second!
An absolute sensation across the talent! Put your hands up make ‘em touch!

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong!
To crash the critic saying, ""is it right or is it wrong?""
If only fame had an IV
Bcby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
NOW MOVE IT JUMP!
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory ""Nostalgia's for geeks"" *walk and make move voice*
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read!
One second I'm a kunst, then suddenly the kunst is me
Pop culture was in art, now art’s in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and SCREAM FOR ME!
LETS GO CMON !

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch !
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch!
CMON WOO !

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Bridge]
Woo...
Woo-Oh!
Woo-oh-oh-oh...

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on be yourselves, clap for each other. Clap for your talent, you’re on your way to the top!
You’re a F* superstar come on!

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch

Put your hands up, make 'em touch

[Post-Chorus]

Some little piggies went to artrave
And the little piggies stayed home
Do me a favour, you beautiful generation. Don’t be so hard on yourself
If you wanna get to where I am today, if you have dreams of being a star, don’t worry about being beautiful, don’t worry about being on YouTube, or Twitter
You rely on your f* talent to get you to the top
Hard work, discipline, passion. And all the little piggies in here will go Wi, wi - Wi, wi
Wi, wi SWINEEE!!
COME ON! LET’S DANCE! JUMP! JUMP!

[Verse 1]
Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another
You're just an animal, trying to act real special !

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine!
Act like a swine!

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Hands up !
Do ya? I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body!
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside!
LET’S GO PARIS!

I hope that you always remember this time in our lives together
When we painted each others faces, and called each other monsters. And talked about love, and art, all night long
Every year, when I travel around the world, I always wonder if things will be different. Maybe one year you won’t come to the show. Or you’ll be less festive or, not dressed up or, something different
But what I realised, during ARTPOP, is that we belong together and some stories have no end
I will follow you, around the world, as long as you have me
Because I love making music, I love making art. And I love, love meeting all of you beautiful creative people
When this song is over, the clock will start ticking, until… the next time

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends..
""'Cause I'm a wandering man,"" he said to me
""And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?""

I appreciate you so much. Thank you for believing in, in me always. I’ll always believe in you
When I die, they’ll say: “Lady Gaga was special. But her fans, her monsters, they were really something.”

[Chorus 1]
So, I said...
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gcpsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
Taylor, im coming home! *smile*
But I can be..
COME ON!!
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
PUT YOUR HANDS UP !
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home!

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, But I can be WITH PARIS TONIIIIIIGHT!!!


Put your hands up for DJ White Shadow, DJ Zedd, and Red One
And we can't forget Billy, and all of you ! I lcve you so much! *claps*

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
""Baby, why do we love each other?""
I said, ""Honey, it's simple !
It's the way that you love and treat your mother.""

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gcpsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and PARIS
'Cause it's you and me
EVERYBODY ALL TOGETHER COME ON!! *sings* BABY FOR LIFEEE!!!!

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy, I'm

[Outro]
Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian kompai
Africa, India, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gcpsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy

-Scheiße-
When I wrote this song many years ago I said I wish that I could dance on one single prayer
I wish I could be strong without permission
But it’s a really strange thing, strength
‘Cause you gotta know what weakness feels like to have it
You gotta put up with some bull s*
So you know, I wrote about a nice sentiment about strength, and being a woman in this very sentimental song
:m SCHEIBE!

This one’s for the girls. Put your hands up, let’s dance

Ich schleiban austa be clair, es kumpent üske monstère, aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, begun be üske but-bair

Scheibe, be mine
Put on a show tonight
Do whatever you like
Scheibe, scheibe be mine
Scheibe, be mine

When I’m on a mission
I rebuke my condition
If you’re a strong female
You don’t need permission ! Hands up !

[Chorus]
I wish that I could dance on a single prayer !
I wish I could be strong without somebody there !
I wish that I could dance on a single prayer !
I wish I could be strong without the scheibe, yeah !
Without the scheibe, yeah
Without the scheibe, yeah
Hey yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Love is objectified by what men say is right
Scheibe, scheibe be mine
Bull shit, be mine
Blonde high-heeled feminists, enlisting femmes for this
Express your womankind, fight for your right ! C'mon !

[Pre-Chorus]
When I’m on a mission
I rebuke my condition
If you’re a strong female
Come on. Step it up! Let’s go!

[Chorus]
I wish that I could dance on a single prayer !
I wish I could be strong without somebody there !
I wish that I could dance on a single prayer ! *raise arm up*

She hides true lcve, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

You know that I love you, boy !
Hct, like Mexico rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandrx
I'm not your bcbe, I'm not your bcbe, Fernandx
Don't wanna k., don't wanna touch

[Interlude]
Stop, please, just let me go

[Verse 2]
She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her bcyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

Don’t call my name, don’t call my name, Alejandro
I’m not your bxbe, I’m not your bxbe, Fernando
Don't wanna k., don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberts

But there is one thing that you missed, in all of those years. So I’m gonna need you all to get on your feet right now. That’s right
THIS IS A PARTY ROBLOX, BE POLITE

You have given me so much love, so much support, so much encouragement for my songwriting, for my singing, for everything, but
You gave me no poker face

Okay good
Well, if anybody’s still sitting down, now really I’m gonna need you to get on your feet for real now
And I got one thing to say to you

Got my ass squeezed by scxy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lcvegame, a lcvegame

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and lcve me
Just wanna t. you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick

Put your hands up Roblox !
[Chorus]
Let’s play a lovegame, play a lovegame, do you want l*ve or you want fame, are you in the game?

*gives disco stick*

[Bridge]
I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a, and a game
And a game!

And a game!
A LOVE GAME !

*does break-dance*

-Telephone-

I lxve you all so much. Yeah I do

I lxve you so much that every time I get on stage I get this whole warm-up, I get my body moving, and I do my vocal warm-ups
And I can see you all out there and I’m thinking about the stage, and the lights and how I’m gonna do the thing

And then sometimes I get a phone call right before and I’m like who is calling me?
I got a sold out arena waiting and I’m kinda busy right now!

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, babx, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore

Can call all you want but there's no one home

Oh that’s quite a lot!

And how many of you are not members of that community?
Okay! That’s right people. That’s good because we like everybody here

‘Cause you know. We all just gotta l*ve each other
The way things are going we just have to give l*ve to all our sisters and all our brothers, ‘cause man
It wasn’t that long ago, we were all just living in the jungle

*sings* So why do we gotta, put each other down, when there’s more than enough love, to g-g-go around!

So, if you’re confused about equality, or you, huh, wanna ask some questions, just come to mama, I’ll tell you everything!

Come to mama, tell me who hxrt ya
There’s gonna be no future, if we don’t figure this out!
Oh, come tomorrow!
Who are you gonna follow?

-Just Another Day-

[Intro]
This next song wasn’t included in the Joanne World Tour regular setlist, but we decided to play it for you tonight

After all, it’s just another day

Yeah man! Play those NY drums!
Let’s show how we do it! Downtown!

[Verse 1]
Just another way to prove
I love you, when it's hard today!
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say that makes me mad I’ll turn away
I'll turn away!
I'll turn away!

[Pre-Chorus]
And think of different ways to keep my spirits up, and choreograph hours with playful, joyous thoughts

[Chorus]
We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey I lcve you ! *smiles*
And after all, it's just another day

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could use some two or three!
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I walk alone down a different street!
And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today

[Pre-Chorus]
And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

[Chorus]
We both know I could learn a thing or two, about behaving, but I lxve you!
And after all it's just another day

Come on, Mark! *point*

[Instrumental Bridge]

(...do what you want...)

Ladies and gentlemen, Brcan Ncwman!

[Chorus]
We both know
I could learn a thing or two
Come on Roblox
About relaxing, but I lxve you!
And after all, it's just another day!

[Outro]
Oooooh oooo, oooooh oooo
Oooooh oooo, oooooh oooo
Oooooh oooo, oooooh oooo
And after all, it’s just another day!

-btw-
Come on, put your paws up! Let me feel your pride!
This is how we do it! Let’s sing it Roblox, come on! Let’s go!


[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause he made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say""

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Interlude]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Interlude]
(Way) Don't be, don't be...
(Way) Church

[Breakdown]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, cholo descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight or bi, lesbian, transgendered life, I’m on the right track baby I was born to survive, no matter black, white, or beige, chxla or orient made, I’m on the right track, baby I was born to be brave!


[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Outro]
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey

Telephone Demo,pop,lady gaga,2008,496,"[Verse 1: Lady Gaga and Britney Spears]
Hello, hello? Baby, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga and Britney Spears]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga and Britney Spears]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Verse 3: Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, both]
Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing
[Chorus: Lady Gaga and Britney Spears]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Honey.. *evil laugh*
Oh..

[Verse 1]
Lcve is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my rcligion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head, like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

[Chorus]
I won't cry for you. *dances*
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See, when you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mare
[Post-Chorus]
Lcve..
Do you smell that ?
It's poison
:m YAAAAAH !

[Verse 2]
We are not just art for Michelangclo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris, cold
J'veux pas mourir tout seule

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head, like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

[Chorus]
I won't cry for you. *dances*
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See, when you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mare

Sorry Joanne, Gaga come's out to play

-Dancin' in circle-

It’s f* hot in Roblox
Look at that costume *points little monster* you are delicious darling
Thank you so much to my beautiful, loyal, amazing fans, you are so filled with talent and joy. I’m so glad all the time…
That’s a very little monster in there *points fan* Hello! I can see you ;)

You know, did anybody get to go to the artr*ve? That was a party
Oh you know, that was my last tour, the artr*ave
And, when I went on tour, I went to my home, which is the first first home I’ve ever had, huh

And I walked around and I said, what am I gonna do now, in this house? Am I gonna write more music?
And I’m gonna go on tour again, ‘cause that’s really what I want to do
And I thought what am I gonna write about? I want so badly to relate to people that haven’t related to me yet, not because I’m
You know, don’t love the fans I have but I think it’s important you know to grab somebody else’s f* hat and try to walk in their sh* for a little while
So I made sure this album, Joanne, that I didn’t just honor the more personal sentiments
I made sure also to honor the h** in my heart
The trap of my spirit
You know one day, I’m gonna have a kid in one arm and a glass of Pxnot Grigio in the other

And as long as I keep dancin’ in circles it’ll feel real good to be lonely. LET’S GO!


[Intro]
Tap down those boots while I. *spin around the circle*
Hands up, lets go ! *waves*
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

[Verse 1]
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time. *tcuch myself*
I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes. *spin*
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize, cmon !

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
*dances*
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out


[Chorus]
I'm singin': Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry *remove the clip*
I'm singin': Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lone-ly. *spin*


[Post-Chorus]
*spin*
*dances*
Funk me downtown

[Verse 2]
I fool myself. Hands up !
Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick, pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive, come alive


[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out

[Chorus]
I'm singin': Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry
*point mic*
Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry
I'm singin': Dancin' in circles, feels good to be, cmon! -ly. *spin around the circle*

[Post-Chorus]
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown!
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown!

[Bridge]
Hurts inside, but not this time. *poses*
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I tcuch myself. *waves*
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin'?

[Chorus]
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
DANCIN' IN CIRCLES, FEELS GOOD TO BE LONELY !

[Post-Chorus]
*spin around the circle*
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown!
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown..!
*dances*

You probably don’t know who I am but I have a tona followers on Snapchat, I’m like an influencer or whatever *looks up*, could you just do me a favour and take my picture? *poses*

Whoever told you that they can make a living with the filter, they lied to you
-
Excuse me umh. Umh
You probably don’t know who I am, most people don’t know who i am but, I have you know a ton of followers in Instagram
And I’m a f. star using filters, if you can just shoot me for my life-style?

Hi. Hey sir. *point* How are you ?
You probably don’t know who I am but I’m born to be a star one day, and I heard I can be on magazine, I have social-medias. So if you can please take my close up
IM BORN TO BE A STAR ! *poses*
I need some fans

*sings* we are the crowd. We are c-coming out
Got my flash on it’s true. Need that picture of you, it’s so magical
We’d be so fantastic-oh

[Verse 1]
We are the crowd, we're c-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true, need that picture of you, it's so magical

We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means, but this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
Put your hands up for Roblox Stars!

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan *waves*
I'll follow you until you lcve me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine. *spin*
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

*dances*
Oh ! NO ! LEAVE ME ! LET ME LONELY !

NO! STOP FOLLOWING ME!
OH! YOU WILL NEVER M.. AAAH!! *gets killed*

-Angel Down-

[Verse 1]
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred?
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Bridge]
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Outro]
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Catch that angel

-Joanne-

*gets guitar*
*sits*

We’re very honored tonight that my latest album ‘Joanne’ is number 8 in United States. Thank you! :)

And I just want to take a, take a little poll here. Don’t worry about it, it’s not gonna offend me, I just wanna know, how many of you here tonight in the audience don’t know who Joanne is?
Oh. I think many people are a bit lost
But, if you do know who Joanne is, that’s amazing
And for those of you wondering tonight, you might be saying, who’s Joanne? *laughs*
And that person, Joanne, is two things. Number 1, my middle name is Joanne, given to me by my parents
But Joanne, was also the name of my father’s sister who I was named after. She died in 1974 of lupus
This loss of my family, it travelled decades and generations that I thought she would be like an angel, from the dinner table
I thought of her and my parents at night, and I study her, so that I might be able to understand my father
So when I asked of all of you tonight, it’s even the joyest moment that we get to spend all together, knowing I know
And many of you know that there are people all over the world they could never afford to go see a live show like this, you are all so very lucky
And as we got time to ask you, I would ask you to honor your own pain in this moment, and take yourself back to that place where you were blasted and your life was changed so much
So much that you don’t even remember who you were before

For me, that pain has only one name, and it’s Joanne

*whispers* one, two, three
*plays guitar*

Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven’s not ready for you…

Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going girl?
Girl, where do you think you’re going! Girl


We both know, things don’t work that way
I promised I, wouldn’t say goodbye, so I grin, and my voice gets thin

Girl, where do you think you’re going?

Honestly I know where you’re going

And I’ll still love you even if I can’t see you anymore. Can’t wait to see you soar

Joanne middle stop speech:
Hello gentlemen
I guess what I’m trying to say is I was trying to figure out myself a little better, and, instead of just staring at myself
I tried to figure out my dad, and my mom, and their pain. And it led me right back home

*sits*
*whispers* one, two, three

*plays guitar*

Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going girl!
Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going, gi-oh-rl!

Call me Joanne

ACT 2,pop,lady gaga,2019,1158,"[Verse 1]
I never was the kind of girl that's
Naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
Hello, i was insecure. *fix hair*
Bonjour !
But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no
--
Oh !

[Chorus]
I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love ! *spin*
Oh, yeah !
I'm gonna be his first and last kc! *grab pic*
'Cause bcby, I was born to be his!
I was made for lcving him!
The Fashion of His Love
[Bridge]
I hope you don't mind cause I gonna say in French tonight, just to remember few things. that's okay ? *shows*

I was made for loving him, ooh yeah !

The first time when I wrote it change my life, lets go !

[Intro: Lady Gaga & Akon]
Gaga

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga & Akon]
I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush
A dizzy twister dance, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys, i lost my phone, phone

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright!

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance !
Spin that record, bcbe!
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance!
Just j-j-just dance
Oh I'm upstairs ! *smiles*
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga & Akon]
Wish I could shut my plcybcy mouth, bye boys
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? *spin*
Control your poison, bcbe
Roses have thorns, they say!
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight *spear coat*

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, hey thanks *grab keytar* LETS GO !

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Just dance
Gonna be okay!
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance

*spear skirt, hat*

-Love Game-
*sit, poses*

[Verse 1]
I wanna you
But if I do, then I might miss you, bcbe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my squeezed by scxy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and lcve me
Just wanna you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
*smokes*

[Chorus]
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame

[Bridge]
I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a, and a game

Bonjour mes petits, i know its hot, tres chaud, very uh, crowded, so get your p* up and JUMP! *jumps* EVERYBODY !

-Telephone-

Merci !

Bonjour mes amis ! And bienvenue, welcome to the Born This Way Ball !

So, thank you, this is a party. I don't, Yes, so beautiful, this is not a funeral if it was, it would be my funeral wich mean dancing, drinking, I don't give a s. it you have work tomorrow
Remember, you can always call me, im the just the telephone call away

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello?
Baby, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breaking up on me *point*
Sorry, I cannot hear you, La France est busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, Cmon hands up !

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop telephoning me!
I'm busy!
Stop telephoning me!

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
C'mon for Beyonce !

[Verse 4: Lady Gaga]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
-
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone with this fever, fever, yeah

There it goes
You stole my soul, and so
'Cause sweetheart, no-no-nobody a-no-no-knows

Kind of menage a trois sometimes

Yeah

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)

With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue

Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)

Because I'm best when I'm in love, and I'm in love with you

Touch me, touch me

Get on top of me
(And Mars' warring spirit rams into the atmosphere)

On GOAT, a government owned territory in space, a birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place. But the birth was not finite, it was infinite.

And thus began the beginning of the new race; a race within the race of humanity; a race which bears no prejudice, no judgment but boundless freedom. But on that same day as the eternal Mother hovered in the multiverse another, more terrifying, birth took place: the birth of evil

And as she, herself, split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces, the pendulum of choice began its dance.

Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute

Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

This feeling, in motion
Watch, watch me now, electric, devotion

I see that I want it, want it (Be free)

Watch life, here I go again

I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

The Sound of Music Medley,pop,lady gaga,2015,234,"[Verse 1]
The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray
I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard bеfore

My heart will be blеssed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

[Verse 2]
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

[Verse 3]
Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever

[Verse 4]
Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
'Til you find your dream
A dream that will need
All the love you can give
Every day of your life
For as long as you live

Been a long time, but I’m back in town
This time I’m not leaving without you

You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I’m not leaving without you

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,""

It’s been two years since I let you go
I couldn’t listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me Neil Young ""Heart of Gold""
With a guitar humming and a no clothes
This time I’m not leaving without you, oh, oh, oh, oh

And you know I put on some country clothes the other day and said I was voting for Joe 'cause I wear cabellas when I'm on a four-wheeler in Pennsylvania. And I will not be told what I can and cannot wear to endorse our future president. So this is what I have to say about that. I might not always look like you, but I am you. We are each other

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down where we belong, the whole damn country

No Floods Demo,pop,lady gaga,2006,55,"[Verse 1]
I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
""There she goes, that crazy girl...
She thinks she's something in this world.""
So I'mma close my ears and dream 'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, therе's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

No matter lightning or thundеr
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
Yeah, you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Verse 2]
On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop, be sure that I'll say ""go""
To the stars and land
Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me, my strong mean
Hey
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

Go ahead and don't believe
Cause everyone needs a way to breathe, and love, and dream
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me

You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own

Who was it that pulled the trigger, was it you or I?
I'm completely numb, why you actin' dumb?
I won't blame myself 'cause we both know you were the one

Then I sit inside it, wondering if I'll behave
It's a game I play, and I hate to say
You're the worst thing and the best thing that's happened to me
These demons, these demons, I must slay, I must slay
Never stop like a song playing and I can't escape
On rewind, on repeat, incessant, all day
Spinnin' it like you're a DJ, torture me on replay

Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A love game, a love game

Hold me and love me, just wanna touch you for a minute

After that sweet Summer afternoon
When for the first time I saw you appear
Dreaming of you I composed a tune
So will you listen to it, dear?

Do I love you, do I?
Doesn't one and one make two?
Do I love you, do I?
Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I?
If you ever should go away?
If the sun should desert the day
What would life be?
Will I leave you? Never
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you for ever?
Isn't heaven forever more?

Let’s Do It,pop,lady gaga,2021,2934,"[Intro]
When the little blue bird who has never said a word starts to sing spring, spring
When the little bluebell in the bottom of the dell starts to ring ding-ding
When the little blue clerk in the middle of his work starts a tune to the moon up above
It is nature that's all, simply telling us to fall in love

[Verse 1]
And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Fins
Folks in Siam do it - think of Siamese twins
Some Argentines without means, do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

[Instrumental Break]
Take it Brian
Mmm
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it - Waiter bring me ""shad roe""
In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

I Wish,pop,lady gaga,2015,261,"Come on!
Ooooh
Come on!

Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so
[Verse 2]
Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
(You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?

We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights

I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rock star in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt, yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry

Loving you is cherry pie

Police 1: I told you she didn’t have a d***
Police 2: Too bad
(Paper Gangsta plays)
Speaker: Lady Gaga, you got a call
Speaker: Beyoncé on the line for Gaga

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Interlude]
Police: It’s your lucky day, some idiot bailed you out
Beyoncé: You’ve been a very bad girl. A very, very bad, bad girl Gaga
Lady Gaga: Mm-hm Honey Bey. Are you sure you wanna do this Honey Bey?
Beyoncé: What do you mean, am I sure?
Lady Gaga: You know what they say, “Once you kill a cow, you gotta make a burger”
Beyoncé: You know Gaga, trust is like a mirror— you can fix it if it’s broke
Lady Gaga: But you can still see the cracks in that mother(bleep) reflection
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

[Bridge: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé, Both]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central S-Station (Station)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
('Cause tonight I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
('Cause tonight I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
(Tonight I'm dancing)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
[Interlude]
Beyoncé: I knew you’d take all my honey. You selfish mother(bleep)

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb

My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, ever since day one
Pop a 911 and pop another one

Turning up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting too manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

I can't see me cry
Can't see mе cry ever again (ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see mе cry
This is the end (ooh)

Ever since day one
Pop a 911
Then pop another one
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save them 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built me around my oasis
Paradise is in my hand
Holding on so tight to this status
It's not real but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry
This is the end (ooh)

My telephone, my telephone
My telephone
My telephone, my telephone
My telephone

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breakin' up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop callin' me, I'm kinda busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Stop telephonin' me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
[Bridge: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé, Both]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringin'
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station (Station)
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'
('Cause tonight I'm dancin') 'Cause I'll be dancin'
('Cause tonight I'm dancin') 'Cause I'll be dancin'
('Cause tonight I'm dancin')
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)

Stop telephonin' me, eh, eh eh, eh, eh!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)

Can call all you want but there's no one home

And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home

'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub

Applause Goldhouse Remix,pop,lady gaga,2013,2,"[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, ""Is it right or is it wrong?""
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make ’em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

I've overheard your theory, ""Nostalgia's for geeks""
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me

She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
