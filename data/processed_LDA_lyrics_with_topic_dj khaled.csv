We Takin Over,rap,dj khaled,2007,173047,"[Intro: Akon, DJ Khaled & T.I.]
Oh oh oh! (DJ Khaled!)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Konvict Music (We The Best!)
Ay, ay, Grand Hustle
Yeah (We takin' over)
Ay, ay, ay
Oww! (Listen!)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Started in Atlanta then I spread out with it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn; holla at me
Be in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland, daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop 6-4, three-wheel, then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a Glock four-fifth, blow your head off with it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off with it
Say you need bricks, I said, ""I'll get it""
[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you (Supply you)
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to (Try to)
Come around and try to stomp on our ground

[Chorus: Akon & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Oh oh (Listen!)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Boss, it's what I does
I get money e'ryday, e'ryday I does
That (Benz) is how I ride
Black flag on the left, two hoes and ride
You better (Move) AK all day
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my neck
I'm big like Diddy; damn it, I'm with it
Khaled, we did it, Biggie of my city
Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
I'd rather get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come runnin' like water
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous
Miami on fire, you better be cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Yeah, they see it but no one reports it
I run this, Rick Ross, boss shit
[Chorus: Akon & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Oh oh (Listen!)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Blat, when you see Crack, better duck
Like the MAC got a EZ pass, nigga what?
Shit, I don't give a fuck, I run these streets
Y'all talk that shit, I walk that beef
I'ma tell you like a G told me
They'll come back quick if a nigga OD
Cash rule everything around me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on Ds
Feelin' like Pac, all eyes on me
Fresh bandana and I'm blowin' mad trees (Trees, trees)
Nigga please
I spit crack, every verse a ki
Some say ""Khaled,"" some say ""Khaleed""
Twelve years down and I'm finally free

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you (Supply you)
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to (Try to)
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
[Chorus: Akon & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Oh oh (Listen!)

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Birdman daddy, I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong, so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam, I'ma give him some
Spent that corner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
Why'd they have to send my baby home?
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a G in the game, now my son on the throne

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Ah, I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I'm untamed, I need a leash
I'm insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on Easy Street?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter pink
And my wrist-wear Chopard but the Müller's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor
Red light, red light, stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the little big kahuna, y'dig?

All I Do Is Win,rap,dj khaled,2010,564846,"[Intro: DJ Khaled & T-Pain]
DJ Khaled
Hey, yeah
We the best

[Chorus: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), and they say yeah (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you going in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, listen, Luda!
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now (Woah)
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down (Woah)
I never went nowhere (No), but they sayin' ""Luda's back"" (Yeah)
Blame it on that conjure (Ha), the hood call it Luda 'gnac (Yah)
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow (Flow)
My hands go up and down (Down), like strippers' booties go (Whoo)
My verses still be servin' (Yup), tight like a million virgins (Yup)
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version (Yah)
Can't never count me out (No), y'all better count me in (Yo)
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in (Whoo)
Make millions every year (Yeah) the South's champion (Yeah)
'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do is
[Chorus: T-Pain, Ludacris & Rick Ross]
All I do is win, win (Ay), win no matter what (Whoo)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)

Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), and they say yeah (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win (Who?)
And if you going in (Boss) put your hands in the air (Boss), make 'em stay there

[Verse 2: Rick Ross & DJ Khaled]
Swervin' in my lo-lo
Head on the swivel, you know serving me's a no-no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger, they see it they say, ""Oh boy""
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo'-fo'
Ask you what you laughing at (What?), represent that mud life (Mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right (Mud right)
We come together holdin' hands and holla ""Thug life"" (""Thug Life"")
We all strapped in all black, it's like fuck life (Fuck life) (All we do is win)
You riding to what (What) 'cause we riding tonight (Tonight)
Now she riding with me 'cause you wasn't riding her right
Ross!

[Chorus: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), and they say yeah (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you going in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there
[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water gettin' boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, ""Just win baby, win""

[Chorus: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), and they say yeah (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down

Them hands go, up; them fans go, up

Who hotter than me (Khaled), I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist
Wake up every morning just to count white faces, Neo in the Matrix
Glorious as Morpheus, employed all warriors
I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Fire and brimstone, yo
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't motherfucker money better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut

Yellow gold cuban, nine mil Ruger
I'll show you what to do with em
Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em
They don't want no problems, they might end up suing em
Disassociate yourself, have nothing to do with em
We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em

Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I’m a rude boy

Go Hard,rap,dj khaled,2008,56829,"[Intro: Kanye West, DJ Khaled & T-Pain]
Ayy, we go by The Runners
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
DJ Khaled, We The Best (Go hard!)
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I do it for the hood, cause the hood told me I should (Go hard!)
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
If you rep your hood, and you goin' hard
If they hatin' on you, don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best (Go, go, go hard!)
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
Fuck nigga, you can't stop this!
Fuck the rest, we run this game, Kanye West, Khaled and Pain

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This is in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am (Hard) I will (Hard) I gots to go (Go hard)
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (Go) go (Go) go (Go) go (Go hard)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I go the hardest, flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself, I mean, ugh, where do I start?
First I spin around and vomit, then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad, won't nobody get up on it
I flow sick, nigga how sick? Seasick
Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I had some wins, some losses
Just a life of a God damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl
With a ass as fat as Tracee Ross's
This is dope as it get, dope as a motherfuckin' acid trip
Fly as fifty-seven passengers, this finna be another classic, bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it then get at it
But I ain't gon' have it, no, I ain't gon' have it

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been the type to bite my words
When I came up, y'all gave me shit
Now I'm finna make y'all eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Go head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care 'bout what you felt
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't nowhere to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
This could fuckin get old, well it's good I'm young
Before my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing y'all got to hear
I'ma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm out of here
[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)

Im So Hood Remix,rap,dj khaled,2007,66054,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
DJ Khaled! We the best
Who? We, nigga! We the best
This the remix! The ""I'm So Hood"" remix!
I'm makin' mo—vies!
I'm so hood, remix!

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Young Jeezy]
(I'm so hood!) Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
We always gon' be the best, man
'Cause you and your man is plannin' to hate (We run this, man)
(I'm so hood!) And I got these golds up in my mouth
I make hit records, man, this is what I do
If you get closer to my house, then you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm out the (Hood!) And if you feel me, put your hands up
I'm out the, this the remix
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
I gave you We Takin' Over (Yo Khaled)
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here you can walk it out
Ay, Young Jeezy (I got 'em, homie)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You got me? (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm (We run this, man, we run this!)
[Verse 1: Jeezy, Ludacris & T-Pain]
I'm so H to the double O-D
Walk around, there's goddamn money on me
Pockets so fat, don't make no sense
Whips so clean, it don't need no tints
Watch so bright, it don't need no light
You know where it were, don't need no mic
Niggas like, ""Young, what you get for your show?""
Tell 'em, ""Same thing I used to get for the blow""
Set 'em on the run, nigga, what I got to lose?
Put 'em in the vans, I ain't talkin' 'bout the shoes
Do the speed limit, watch out for the lights
Pussy ass niggas, gotta watch out for the dykes
Seventeen-five, yeah nigga, I said it
Seventeen-five, yeah nigga, I meant it
And when we do it bad, but I'm doin' good (In my hood, Luda!)
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so motherfuckin' (Hood!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris & T-Pain]
Look here, everybody come equipped with bangers
Throwin' up our middle fingers
And you know I don't slip
So I gotta keep ten in the clip and one in the chamber
Better be walkin' with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Through the stress and strife
Had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals (Hood!)
I'm in the zone, holmes, goin' for the two-point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris shoulda been on the original version
But this is the remix, with the cheap tricks, hittin' sweet licks
And I cut the braids off
But the waves and the fade'll make you seasick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way that we brawl
So put a fist in the air if you care
That united we stand and divided we fall
When the South's in the house, better watch your mouth
'Cause we on that hood shit
I'm hood rich, comin' around your hood, bitch
I swear I'm so—
[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Busta Rhymes]
I'm so hood! (Remix!) and if you feel me, put your hands up
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
Khaled, they actin' like we ain't
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here you can walk it out
The kings of the streets and the gods of the hood
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Busta Bust, bitches!
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so hood!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes & T-Pain]
See all I know is how to go and get my money again and again
Top down, let the money blow in the wind
With a bad bitch sittin' in the passenger seat
With a doobie-wrapped head full of bobbie pins
You know I keep that thang when I walk
See the dialect different from the slang in my talk
Baby still leavin', got a crackhead frontin'
Got another bad bitch that'll boost for the spark (Hood!)
I'm used to leavin' the strip last
Hustlin' until the sun comes up gettin' cash
So much bread in all of my four pockets
It look like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood
Niggas idolize me and try to do what I does
And if that other nigga ain't really from the hood
You can easily die, tell who that fake nigga was (Hood!)
And even though I spit a little rap
Got niggas in the hood tryna sell the most crack
Violator, I send a nigga to do it
Just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit back!
Y'all niggas know where I'm from
And I rep it to the fullest 'til the day that I'm done
So hood where we live, if a nigga sold drugs
And he rich, momma still proud of her son! (Hood!)
[Verse 4: Big Boi & T-Pain]
Daddy Fat Saxxx so hood like the Cadillac
Ornament, on from the Babylon
Call an ambulance to come and pick that ass up
Cause the nigga never had the chance
They tryna dance with the devil in a pale moonlight
Advance on a level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fella like the man in blue lights
Whoop, whoop, do it twice (Hood!)
Your boy the B-I-G
I'm nicer than MC in your top three
You cocky, I cock, squeeze
Bust them things, now you sloppy
Speed it up, slow it down then screw it
Don't bite the flow cause I got that fluid
Run through the crew on some whole other new shit
Newness, bitch, we do this

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
I'm so hood! (Remix) and if you feel me, put your hands up
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here, you can walk it out (Alright)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout (Weezy!)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so hood!

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne, T-Pain & Fat Joe]
I'm so Hollygrove, New Orleans (Lil Weezyana)
Home sweet, Home Depot, you will need a hammer
It go down like Frasier, I ain't talkin' Kelsey Grammer
I be shittin' on you boys, I need a Alka-Seltzer sandwich, ugh (Hood!)
Since I heard Plies, I done bought the Phantom back
And went and got me a fifty-two inch Maybach (Calca, ghetto gatka, haha)
I'm eatin' like a big dog, I'm so full, I'm so good
I'm so straight, you so fake, I'm so real, I'm so hood (I'm so hood!)
Yup, crack, crack, crack, crack-crack-crack-crack-crack-crack

[Verse 6: Fat Joe, T-Pain & Birdman]
Yeah nigga, welcome to the Crackhouse
I should own a McDonald's the way I bring the MAC's out
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies
Flip a couple grams, they tell you they bakin' pies, shit (Hood!)
Still got my name carved in that central bookin'
Gave that pussy a scar and told her, ""Good lookin'"" (Yeah)
You's a crack baby, that means your momma paid me
You can't even blame me, that's what the hood made me

[Verse 7: Birdman & T-Pain]
Martin Luther King, Calliope, Magnolia, Melpomene
Gettin' that money with a triple beam
We ride on Clyde, on Josephine
Saints is my team, that's what we breathe nigga
That's how we eat, get this money on the streets nigga (Hood!)
VL my street, blood, five star G, blood
Fly as a bird, got these eagles on my seat, blood
Then head back where I stay, 3rd Ward, we get that cake
Thirteen is where I lay, shouts out to M-I-A (Hood!)

[Verse 8: Rick Ross & T-Pain]
Mo' money, mo' problems, don't call me conceited
Just call me the boss, always got what you needed
M-I-Yayo so hot, but my neck got the fever
If you sneeze, you get shot, Gunplay makin' believers (Hood!)
I just bought me a ranch, watch the hundreds stacks
No, those ain't Rolex diamonds, what you done to that?
You fools fugazi, my fools from Haiti
I moves 'em daily – it's a movie, baby!

Brown Paper Bag,rap,dj khaled,2007,39629,"[Pre-Hook 1: Young Jeezy]
Just got a hundred of that brown paper bag money
You niggas really wanna talk money?
Shit real, that's all I can tell 'em
Just wrap 'em up good so the dogs can't smell 'em

[Hook: Dre]
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Thank God for those days, thank God for those nights
Though it might seem wrong, thank God for that white
They used to call me the Pyrex kid
A.K.A. Young Arm & Hammer
In the kitchen with the pots, yeah I work the glass
Hard on 'em, pimp, yeah I work 'em tass
And when they came in, we unpacked 'em all
Broke 'em all down and unwrapped 'em all
Just two words nigga, duffel bag
I just know it so well, can't help but brag
Gold Mouth got 10, Mel Man got 3
It's just your luck the rap game got me, hold up
[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Here we go again
Just spent a hundred of that brown paper bag money all on Timbs
And the bad **** all on him
'Cause the cars that he drives are all foreign
The game is mine, I'm so far in
I'm speaking with an accent you just caught wind
Can't even relax in my room
That brown paper bag money push my mattress through the roof
This for my **** gettin' brown paper bag money
This for my strippers gettin' black plastic bag money
We talkin' 'bout that bad money
That IRS can't tax money, ya dig me?

[Pre-Chorus: Rick Ross]
Just made a hundred of that brown paper bag money
I thank God for the mil' he prepared for me
Take care my fam and my little dog, money
Thank God for that brown paper bag, that

[Chorus: Dre & Rick Ross]
Brown Paper Bag (Thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag  (Boss, c'mon)
Brown Paper Bag  (Thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag  (We the best)
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Just pulled over in my CM 5
Big bottle on the dash, hope he let me slide
Got 20 in the trunk, you can bet me five
20 minutes and they dump, I'mma let these fly
We the best! Look at what we drive
Got pic-nic tables on my lap, gettin' high
In the back of the Maybach, and it cost five
Hundred thou and a nigga spent that with a smile
Stackin' numbers at alarmin' rates
White house, still move a brick of raw in a day
I'm that Bin Laden boy, I'll bomb ya state
I ain't come to stay, I got a postbar and a date
Two million in a bag, ain't one to brag
You don't know the feelin' when the villain peelin' in a Jag
Just starin' at the ceilin', ten woman at your pad
I was at the center, now I see villain just in fact, I'm a Boss

[Pre-Hook 3: Lil Wayne]
Just spent a hundred of that brown paper bag money
It feels good to be Young Money, Cash Money
Rehab, I'm addicted to fast money
I got stacks of rubber bands up in that

[Hook: Dre]
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Practice make perfect, I'm relaxing at rehearsal
I'm a mothafuckin' professional, like Herschel
Walker, the talk of the game, is I
But I wonder will they still be talkin' after I die
But that's not important, money's more important
And understand I been in that water like I was snorklin'
Understand I been in that water like I'm a dolphin
Miami, Khaled took me in like an orphan
Why did they start him, now they can't park him
I go into the booth and just change like Clark Kent
Lamborghini dark tint, philly blunt cigar scent
I'm by myself cause niggas run they mouths like auctions
T-Street's my brother, FeFe's my brother
And we stay on point like a fucking box cutter
Ya heard what I say, mothafucka did I stutter
With my brown paper bag here to represent the hustle, I'm out

[Pre-Hook 4: Fat Joe]
Coka baby, man you know I already had money
Definition of that brown paper bag money
Try front and I'll zip you in a bag, money
For the cash, I'll blast anybody, that

[Hook: Dre]
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag

[Verse 5: Fat Joe]
Ya'll niggas want coca music
Lacostra Nostra flow, show ya how to do this
Pin it so easy, a caveman could do it
Nigga, we simply the best, don't confuse it
I confuse it, critics be hating
Best album yet, don't give me the same rating
I'm waiting top of Rap Rushmore
Etched in stone, right beside Pun's noy
Unsure, anythings possible
4 mill spent, bought out the Art Basel
I'm Picasso, in a Versace suit
Don't worry my nigga, Khaled I got you
Not just cause I want to, cause I got to
Put the squad on your back, the impossible
It's only logical to spit it from the heart
Brown paper bag, who else but Joe the God?
That

Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job

Check in the game now I'm back in the light, yeah
I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I am absolutely, positively on my grizzy
Even though I'm sick and I'm tired, I gets busy
Started a 62, but it ended up a frisbee
And me, I like to stand at the stove until I'm dizzy
Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
I give it all up before I let the fame get me
I got niggas tryin' to sue me, bitches tryin' to do me
Way these niggas actin', you'da thought they never knew me
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
I'm fed up, it's why I'm actin' like the old me
[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm sick and tired of you suckers so now I'm fed up
Somebody catch the chain, I'm 'bout to tear his head off
Shawty bendin' over knowin' I'm 'bout to tear it up
Before you let your top back, get your bread up
Made history, but now we claimin' victory
Get ya out the White House, go back to your efficiencies
Suckers feel me and I know you haters hear me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
Like the IRS, you wonder what I'm makin, yearly!
With them brown bags circulate, so I perpetrate
We shinin' than the bottom cause we're down to twerkulate
Lookin' at the parking lot; better get your mind right
I hope you fed up being broke because the times right
Ross!

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uhh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em
He leaned over and told me, ""Just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death, just never die on 'em""
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin' overtime to damagin' my name
And somehow I'm still the hottest motherfucker in the game

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
(I’m happy to be back man!) I’m tired of these haters
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y’all pre-natal
I just get the beat and murk it out like Fredo
Uhh, I’m sick of bein' criticized
That’s why I’m higher than the Star Trek Enterprise
I do it big, don’t get mad cause you minimized
I keep a red flag in case I get penalized
Uhh, it's Young Money like you didn’t know
Stop playin', I hit Drizzy with the give-and-go
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
Who trying to see us? You seein' things
Hustle like I still pay rent man
Got a chest full of heart, no Tin Man
Uhh, Kha-Kha-Khaled I’m fed up
Flow wake the dead up, Weezy
[Verse 5: Usher]
Yeah, hop out, I been in this, been breakin records since '94
So I ain't gotta brag about records that I’ve broke
Records that I hold and records that I’ve sold
And I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo (yeah)
Don’t bite the hand of your provider
You sayin' I ain’t influenced you, you a liar
I’m on fire, you just a biter
You need to wake up and realize

DJ Khaled!
Cash Money, Young Money, We the Best
Khaled, I got you!
Welcome to my hood, hee
Where the hood at? (Huh)
Where the hood at? (Uh-huh)
YMCMB (Rozay!)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood, they outside playing hopscotch
And everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police
In my hood

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Audemar on my wrist, diamonds look like they glowing
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'
Treat them like jack boys, catch them slipping then slay them
Lord, forgive me for my sins
That's my confessions, if they put me in this Benz
I got possession of a federal offense
I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent (Huh)
So wear ya vests and I'm still gon' stunt like it ain't no tomorrow
Fuck ya house note, nigga, blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back (Rozay)
Tell you “We The Best forever"", DJ Khaled handle that (Huh)
[Chorus: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it

(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police
In my hood

[Verse 2: Plies]
I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Noriega
I’m talkin’ Noriega, nigga, the real Noriega
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell Congress when you see 'em, bitch, I'm stealin' cable
And leave the D-Boys alone cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers?
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support
Some of them did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr. Landlord, we gon' bust your ass with an eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo
I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y'all can

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bitch, I’m on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time flies, well mine’s first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell 23
Tell the warden kiss my ass, pockets on Monique
Bitch I’m from the murder capital, ho, I’m far from practical
Shit happens and since I’m the shit, I’m who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I’m red hot
I don’t see nobody, see no body like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewn up, check the thread count
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB, Khaled I gotcha!)

[Chorus: T-Pain & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody (Ugh)
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys

Welcome to My Hood Remix,rap,dj khaled,2011,113041,"[Intro: DJ Khaled & T-Pain]

(Welcome to my hood, hee)
Let's go, remix, remix, remix
(Where ya hood at) Remix!
(Where ya hood at) Remix!
(Where ya hood at) Remix!

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled, & Ludacris]
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it, ugh
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevys
24s, so you know we roll heavy, ugh! (Y, M, C, M, B!)
Welcome to my hood
Where they gettin' fly like a G6
And everybody know this is the remix
Welcome to my hood (Miami-Dade County, 305)
Them boys will put you down on yo knees
We The Best Music
(Woop, woop!) That’s the sound of the police in my hood
Stop playin' wit em! Luda!
[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Everybody on the corner with the work
Slangin' and bangin' in front of that liquor store (Oh!)
Blowin' money 'cause I live life fast
With this bottle full of 'gnac, I'ma sip this slow (Oh!)
Singles double when triple-beams take over
Now holler 'cause these Impalas got extreme makeovers (Woo!)
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street now
Wear the wrong color, catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is quotin' scriptures
While Luda's getting head, more gums than baby pictures (Woo!)
Cock my .40 Glock and my partner just bought a replica
Now Asians sayin' they don't keep no cash in they register
(Hurry up and buy!)
We run from red and blue lights to get that green
But whoever got that white is winning like Charlie Sheen! (Woo!)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Hey! Teddy Pain (Teddy Pain) Bad man (Bad man)
Mix shots, boom-(boom)-boom-(boom)-boom-(bang)!
Man, we the best, never the less, you know we get it hot
Fire (flame, flame), fire—fire (flame)
Put me on the track and I'ma really let a motherfucker feel it
When I do it, how I do it, what I do (Do)
If a nigga really wanna test (Come and test)
You can bet that I'ma eat 'em all day (Fuck food!)
850, what I represent ('Sent)
Talla-home Florida president ('Sent)
Me and DJ Khaled got these haters lookin' hesitant, yeah (Oww)
So keep all that wackness out my ear
(Boop, boop!) That’s the sound of your career in my hood—
[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you niggas got your ringside seats
'Cause it's whoop-ass season

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
(Coming to a hood near you!)
Everybody know what happen
When you see me comin' (Back up!)
I be hurdling and got you regurgitating
And murdering everything (Gunshots!)
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop
(Y'all know what it is!) I'm coming to get it
And others are blocking
I'm runnin' the hood and can't nothin' come top it
You can Google it and you can search it (Oooooh!)
On how a nigga come and unlock it
Impossible for you to stop it (Damn!)
(More fire 'pon di place!) Now go and heed the villain
You're like, ""He's injured"" and prob'ly need a medical situation
Because the way I'm fuckin' everything up 'til the people dead
Why you tryna do it? You already know that I'm the king with it
And, you don't wanna come behind me with it, bro! (Hunh!)
I killed this shit! I ain't gotta rhyme no more, man! Tch!

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!
[Verse 4: Twista & Mavado]
Welcome to my hood
Where board members and faculty backin' me
If you ever try attackin' me
That could be when I eat 'em, especially when I beat 'em
When they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me
I'm an anomaly to 'em, put 'em on crutches
With succulent verses, I'm just the one that's kicking the ruckus
Munch as I smoke a Dutchess, and model bitches that cut us
And motherfuckers that love us, and enemies wanna touch us
I'ma spit a flow as if it was a sin (Haha, what!)
Then the gangstas are resting up forever (Ah...)
See a silent four-, put it on the fin (What!)
Then you know to never test him
It'll be a category F5 (Ayyy)
Handle military with automatic weapons, so let's ride (I...)
Love to the Hundreds, and everybody that runnin' them north
And the whole city, and I'm from the westside (Wan', today)

[Verse 5: Mavado]
Welcome to the gully where we no take bad up
Big spliff in ah mi hand (Haha) and Hennessy in ah mi cup
You see the gyaldem we have up is like some angels abduct
Them fat-tongue, grabba, yah hear me? Haha
When you pass the gate, written at the entrance
""Violate: Straight death sentence""
To live, you must be great; to be a snake, no repentance
We coming at you with vengeance

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 6: DJ Khaled]
Never slippin', I'm ballin', Puff keep on callin'
I don't see none of you pussies (I ain't tryna hear that shit)
Fuck that shit you be talkin'
Rep Miami, the ghettos (Dade County)
Every hood and the projects
And when I drop off my singles
I'm droppin' one of my targets (Tsssss)
Lord, forgive me for my sins (God, forgive me)
I gave you hits—I gave you ""All I Do Is Win"" (I won't stop)
I live this shit
And We The Best, it’s no pretend (I'm for real about this)
I'm touching millions, throwin' hundreds in this bitch

[Interlude: Birdman]
Yeah!
Uptown, swagged-out, let's get it (Aw-ah! Aw-ah!)

[Verse 7: Birdman]
R-Real nigga, number one (Yeah)
Hustle fly with my son (Junior!)
Come from Uptown (Believe that)
G5 Tommy gun (Tommy gun)
Red flag every day
Hundred mil' ready to spray (Ready to spray)
Swagged-out nigga, Bugatti with the paper plates
B-B-Blowing on some good, nigga (Good, nigga)
Feeling good, nigga (Feeling good, nigga)
Stunna Island
Me and Khaled on the wood, nigga (On the wood, nigga)
You understand? Shinin' like I know we should
Birdman, YMCMB, we good, nigga! Yeah

[Verse 8: Ace Hood]
Broward! (Brr-r-rat!)
Ace Hood in this bitch, ho
Kickin' down in your front door
Knock-knock, you hear the Glock cock
And that thing pop on that four-four (Brr-r-rat!)
Posted on it, that same block
I'm in the droptop with that bankroll
Young—Young nigga, I'm out here
Can't name a place that I can't go
Ridin' round with 'bout fifty grand
And they wonder, ""What do that safe hold?""
Middle finger them Feds
And that's what I pledge—a part of my G code
And it's fuck them prosecutors; hustler, connoisseur
It's We The Best Forever
Make sure you spread the rumor, bitch

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 9: Fat Joe]
Good coke, hard rock, stashed in the body shop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggas gettin' left right in front of the Marble precinct
Leave 'em like them Jordans, red-dot, leakin'
I'm fifteen when I first startin' coppin' pies
You 46 just turnin' Blood? Stop it, Five
It's like the only way to make it is supplyin' things
Hoop dreams, dunkin' over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse 10: Game]
Yo, it’s that black raw, black dawg
Pullin' up on that black Hog
Compton, that's my backyard
That's where I used to get them sacks off
But now I got platinum plaques in the back of the 'Bach
And I'm back with Dre again
Aftermath, We The Best, me and Khaled, Dre and Em
Detox, RED, that's back to the back
Step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga, I'm so hood even though I'm living good
Niggas still in the VIP strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks, then, it's back to the trap
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the 'Lac
REDRUM if you try it; nigga, it's Westside!
Throw it up! Now!

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 11: Jadakiss]
They knockin' packs off (Off), they lettin' gats off (Off)
Medicaid benefit cards, scratch-offs (Mmm!)
Savin' every dime (Yeah), tryna choke a quarter
And they ain't sellin' crack (Nah), they sellin' coke and water (Woo)
Smokin' or ya snortin' (Ahh), they coppin' all the Jordans (Yeah)
Nothing's more important, steal 'em if you can't afford 'em (Yup)
I'm gettin' to the money (Money), I need another comma
Some of 'em love the drama (Yeah)
More than they love they mama, ugh!

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 12: Bun B & Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah! Welcome to the land of the trill
Well, everybody walkin' with they hand on they steel
And the model is a supply and demand, and at will
You been outta line with the wrong man and get killed
When you damned if you will, damned if you won't
Lot of dudes sayin' that they can, but they don't
And a lot of boys sayin' that they Gs, but they ain't
Mess around, get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, say what you do
'Fore I come around your hood, broad day, with the crew
They got them FNs, ARs and Ks with 'em, too
And they will gladiate all day, what it do! (what it do)
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it
To my Gs on lockdown, acquitted
Stick with it, think I'ma stop reppin' PAT, forget it
RIVERDALE! Waka! Flocka! Waka! Flocka!

[Verse 13: Waka Flocka Flame]
Welcome to Clayton County (Ugh! Ugh!)
My house got surrounded (Ugh! Ugh! Flocka!)
Enemies tryna drown me
But my hood still around me (RIVERDALE!)
Rookie of the year (Yeah!), no Freshmen cover
Shawty 16 years old, with four baby mothers (Flocka!)
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET (Uh-huh)
And since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street (Ugh!)
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on the TV (Flocka!)
Every day is a party on Grove Street

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
I got what you need, Kim give it to you real
The highs and the lows, however you wanna feel
You want that nod out? I got that NyQuil
You want that Matrix? Then choose the right pill
Fuck I think I do this shit for my health?
Same clothes every week and y'all ain't seein my wealth
On the low, I keep a bankroll like Fresh
Cocktail dress by John Galliano
In a restaurant owned by Taliano's
I'm a boss bitch, my last name should be Soprano
Switchin' up phones so them boys can't follow
They tryna link me to the old address
I left in '02 and ain't been back since
I'm in a new state, a new place with new plates
Shit, damn near a new face
So by the time they try to build them a new case
I'm gone like yesterday - what?
[Chorus: Akon, R. Kelly & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
We takin' over, one city at a time, yeah
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)

Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Oh oh (Jeezy)

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
Look, I am the streets
Real nigga shit and that's word to Meech
She like my wrist so she follow the rainbow
Now I'm switchin' lanes, she tryna follow the Lambo
Can't keep up bitch? Follow the Range Rove'
But be cool cause my goons in there
And a couple of guns, and a couple of clips
And a couple of K's, and a couple of bricks
And then I throw it in the pot, now what the fuck that cook like?
Marc Jacobs don't know what the fuck I look like
Ay, this a remix, ain't it?
Just copped a new 'Rari and I just might paint it
Just copped a new plane and I just might fly it
Just left Lenox Mall and I just might buy it
Stay strapped, nigga, don't even try it
Pockets so fat, I need to go on a diet

[Chorus: Akon, R. Kelly & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
We takin' over, one city at a time, yeah
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)

Im From the Ghetto,rap,dj khaled,2007,5198,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We the besssst..
I represent the hood..
I represent the ghetto..
I represent the people..
I represent YOU - LISTENNN!!!

[Chorus: Dre & The Game]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects (Ayo Khaled)
All over the world and every hood they know
(Walk with me) I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto)
[Verse 1: The Game]
Yeah, that's what got me here
The Chucks, the khaki suits, all the swap meet years
The six dollar socks, the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace, he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones, the fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dawg
Dog turn the TV off, got tired of watchin Jigga boss
So we told our moms we is lookin for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas
Project or the ghetto, ghetto and the projects
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect, so

[Chorus: Dre & Jadakiss]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho' (Uh-huh)
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from (Hahhh-hahhh) the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from (Yeah) the projects (Uhh)
All over the world and every hood they know (They know)
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho' (I'm from the ghetto)
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uhh, Ain't no help there
Just food stamps, weight checks and welfare (uh-huh)
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicate card for health care
Yeah, if you never got knocked then you made it (ha-ha)
Everybody know eachother if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the 80's
Six months, five years for you just to cop out (yup)
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out (yup)
Fights break out when you wired and start joking (huh)
Alot of OG's retired and started smokin
House party games of spade sweet Kool-Aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore, I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid
Get em

[Chorus: Dre & Trick Daddy]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know (ha-ha)
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho' (I'm from the ghetto) (Ha)
[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a lil doe and forget where they come from (come from)
Man we used to have good times (oh)
But since you moved on up guess you ain't cool with us (uh-uh)
We still support you tho we don't see you much (yup)
You ain't the first fool it's cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how far you came and help you keep them thangs? (show up)
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same (damn)
I guess new homies came with his fame (say what)
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives, few kids scattered here (that's right)
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared, the ghetto'll still be here, haa

[Chorus: Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto

Destroy You,rap,dj khaled,2006,1099,"[Intro 1: Dre]
(This is, this is, this is
Yeah.. yeah, uh-huh, uh uh, c'mon)

[Intro 2: Krayzie Bone]
Yeah check it out y'all, it's them Bone Thug niggas
In the house with that nigga Twista, DJ Khaled
Duece-double-oh-six, we 'bout to do it like this - yo

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

[Verse 1: Twista]
Twista spit it for hustlers, Twista spit it for hoes
But I'm 'bout servin these haters like I'm servin that 'dro
Spit for my gangstas and killers that'll put one in yo' dome
Spit it for my ballers and thugs that's addicted to chrome
Either rims or the thumper, now you ain't gotta wonder
What a Twista and here I go and never on drama
With purple 'bout a pound, and my truck I pound the sounds
And my 24's got blades on them that spin round and round
Back on the scene now, and I'm always seen high
Still flow motion overdosin, smokin on green now
When I'm on them Jordans, 20's look like 17's now
Sportin throwback Jordans from when I was 17 now
Still I'm steady +Po' Pimpin+, still spinnin and hustlin
Still +Adrenaline Rushin+ like when the pendulum's cuttin
Album comin out soon, but I already had props
Pullin Benz's up on the block before I met yo' pop
[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

[Verse 2: Twista]
The Twista, playa balla, slash pimp MC
Straight from Chi-Tizzle my nizzle, never gon' get rid of me
On some (this is, this is) and they call us C.M.T
When they drop on how pop on about how it's so fly bein me
With a lethal chemistry, put them in your memory
When you want that original sound, it's either him or me
The most underrated artist in this whole industry
If rappin was the NBA I'd be Michael Finley
Still I'm bendin and grinnin, still I got pull in the club
Still I'm poppin my collar, grindin on girls in the club
Servin 50's, rims is bigger but I got love for the dub
They love the Twist' like love for the chief, and love for the thug
Cause I got that com' game, and I got that bomb flame
Let alarms ring when you hear the don's name
I copped the H-2-1's, some throwbacks like LeBron James
This time around I'mma let my nuts and my platinum charms hang
[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

[Verse 3: Twista]
T be poppin them tags, T be coppin them Jags
And if the T do a stick-up you be droppin them bags
And I'm from where they cock hats instead of rockin them rags
And if they ain't cockin them hats they be cockin them mags
T be thuggin and clubbin, ""Oh Twista that look tight""
Don't every time he step in the party he look so nice?
I'm officially fresh in my gear as I'm rockin mo' ice
And the Mitchell & Ness from the year when I used to flow like
Annilisms are my verbal metabolisms
Shatters prisms and my thug mannerism's of cataclysm and I'm
Causin some dis-establishment-arianism
I vary in wisdom, wins only cause I'm carryin ism and I'm
A street lyrical phantom, full of verses when I chant 'em
When this shit here hit the street it's gon' be the ghetto's anthem
[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Bone Thugs, Twista, DJ Khaled, Listennn!

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

Go Hard Remix,rap,dj khaled,2008,36050,"[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I'm up out M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t
Ain't no other motherfucker in the rap game harder than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top
I'm OnStar for new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie, hand on my cock
Big Homie from the back block
When you first learned how to slap box
Then you even learned how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back, rock
Number one rule: if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor, I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude, but...
Yup! Fuck you, pay me!
I drown my pain in Porsches, I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes, see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest or I could just call this a night
On dark nights, it's like I see better
On Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs, motherfuckers can't kill my buzz
Wait, I ain't done; I'ma freestyle this, Khaled let it run
What's the hardest county in the Yayo?
'Cause I'ma go harder then they go
I'ma go harder than Baltimore
Philly gon' say they can't touch the boy
Where you at Duval? I'ma go harder than you all
Harder than New York, turn the Pro Tools in the booth off
I'ma go harder than Ye go
And Ye go hard; that's baby bro
Put some more beat on that joint
[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm gunna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon head spit that murder I wrote
Man I dont care what what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of me, she gon go down
Maybe I would've slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin old but its good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be numba one
I guess its gon be what its gon be
But heres one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck ya'll niggas I'm out of here
[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me

DJ Khaled, we the best
Who we, nigga? We the best
The Runners
I represent the ghetto across the world
If you represent the hood, two hands in the sky
I'm so (Hood)
Listen

[Chorus: T-Pain & Trick Daddy]
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house
Then you'll know what I'm talking 'bout, I'm out the (Hood)
And if you feel me, put your hands up (Hood)
My hood niggas, can you stand up? (I'm so hood)
If you not from here, you can walk it out (Walk it out)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talking 'bout (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm)
[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
Everybody wanna motherfuckin' know why
I dress so fly, sit so high
Bitch, I do it for the hood (For the hood)
Bitch-ass niggas, I do it 'cause I could, ha ('Cause I could, ha)
Heavy starch in my jeans, please (In my jeans, please)
4X in my white tees (In my white tees)
Living life like a G
That's why these bitch-ass niggas wanna fight me
But I ain't gon' play wit 'em
Uh-uh, rather let the AK hit 'em (Fa-fa-fa)
Tough niggas get fucked up and put on ice
For the rest of they life
I'm straight out the hood, bruh (Straight out the hood, bruh)
See, that's who I do it for
And my low class ghetto ass
Just renewed my ghetto pass

[Chorus: T-Pain & Rick Ross]
(I'm so hood)
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place

[Verse 2: Rick Ross & T-Pain]
Four-five off in the ride (Ride)
Four blunts for me to get high (High)
You feel the bump when I ride by (I'm so hood)
I got 'em hatin', talkin' like Plies (Plies)
Niggas keep droppin like flies (Flies)
Snitchin' ain't gon' cut no time (I'm so hood)
I'll murder one of you fuck niggas
Rob you for your last
Then off come the mask (I'm so hood)
More money, more mayhem
The yayo and millions, I made 'em (What?)
My Maybach is mine, my city is mine, I made it, Boss

[Verse 3: Plies & T-Pain]
Damn my P.O., y'all can tell her I said it
Violate me if she want, gon' have to come catch me
Piss test me all you want, I'ma smoke when I'm ready
Pants hangin' off me now 'cause my pistol heavy (Hood)
I ain't spoke to you yet, dog, 'cause I ain't friendly
I drink 'Gnac, homie, y'all drink Crist'
I like bust-it babies, I don't want that bougie bitch
I'd never buy a Phantom, twenty-eights can't fit
They say I'm fed bound, they call me high risk
I'm a full-blooded goon, lames make me sick
You gettin' three or four birds, where I'm from, we call you rich
I'd like to thank the hood, homie, you taught how to whip

[Chorus: T-Pain]
(I'm so hood)
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house
Then you'll know what I'm talking 'bout, I'm out the (Hood)

We The Best

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
All the bullshit stops here (Here)
Let's get this clear (Yeah)
Shoot rear, fresh off the top tear (Unhh)
What I'mma 'bout to do for you, is not fair
I'm not answerin' questions for you, dat are not clear
Whuddup with State Prop. the crew, when they not there?
The moment dat they heard it the verdict, when it wasn't clear
Ya boi had the to sit a year, did they really disappear?
Jay really not visit there? Dame and Beans are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from dat same fabric
Now rip the rock marriage straight from seams
Thing's ain't what it seems but at time do tell, the truth shall prevail
Until then, you dudes bite yall nails in anticipation (Fuck)
I know you hate it why I got chu waitin? (Shiiit..) - I too, am waitin'
Gotta see a couple faces, when I make 'em face it
Truth dat is dat ya boy have patience (Yes!)
As a matter a fact, it's wearin' thin
But I tell you this tho, when the New Year begins
Pussies who got nuts cause I'm goin' all in
[Hook: Pooh Bear]
Are you listening ? (heeey) Plead for attention (heeey)
But it ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)
It ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)
I'm the plot in every movie yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you dont wait (Ooooh)
It ain't good if you dont wait (Ooooh)
Nah-uhhh..

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say dat diss record - I don't diss my dudes!
Outta respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you I couldn't get dat rude
Ionn give a fuck but I couldn't get dat crew
Cause knowin what I do I can get like (Khh) ouu
You wanna know what I do, don't cha?
You'd love it if I told you lil' fuckers, won't cha?
Uh-unh, scrap gotta pay for this one
Sorry youngin', got to wait on this one (Yes)
The Solution, soon in stores
Date to be posted, until then - I'm on pause

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Yeah, to DJ Khaled aka We The Best
Beanie Sigel (Whudd!.. Ain't no more too it)
Give 'em more man, more
[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Well fuck it I don't wanna stop
Whatchu forgot the gun'll pop
Tell me who ya wanna rock
This true love, Roc-a-Fella 'till I die
Nigga keep it movin', don't get caught up in this drive-by
The break's over, ya boi 'bout to take over
If dat number one spot opens, give it here (Here)
Get my crown, dust of my chair
And yall niggas can kiss my ass before I sitted there
Back from the dead (Unhh) fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed (Get it clear!)
By the way, the wars on - you can't call it off
It's too late once the boss involved
Here I come!!

Are you listening ? (heeey) Plead for attention (heeey)

The Originators,rap,dj khaled,2007,3566,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Yeah, we the best, Cool & Dre
DJ Khaled, oh you think it's a game, huh?
I introduce you to
Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, Wish Bone
Incarcerated right now, Flesh Bone
We ain't forget about you nigga
Bone Thugs, the originators
Nigga don't get it fucked up where you got your flow from
Bone Thugs, it's your time, nigga we the best!
LISTENNN! Representin all the ghettos across the world
Nigga we ghetto! We from the hood! We do this!
Let's take it to the projects

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's Bone Thugs, we be them Bone Thugs
Half of this industry's swingin from our baaaaalls

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
I told 'em I'mma get up, get out and get somethin
But I was a little bitty nothin, in the city thuggin
Never been a nigga that's never done less than 100%
The hustle is in me
My thug mentality showed me
What to do to improve my salary
Don't nobody move or you could be a casualty
Why you would really wanna cross paths with me?
One nigga left and they thought we was done
Don't think you'll get rid of the twist of the tongue
They thought we was finished but we just beginnin
They want me committed for the murder one
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, my competition, ready to die
Opposition, never survive, when I get done, bustin my rhyme
I'm a criminal transformed to a lyrical bad storm
Did I mention my fast flowin
Lately has got my cash growin and ass showin
These niggas can't see Bone, they already know
Came down with a style unfamiliar sound
That's how we kicked in the do'
What it be like? Bone Thug nigga born and bred in the Cleveland street life
And believe we ain't goin nowhere, we permanent, posted up like street lights
We do it, still get to it, undisputed, who would of knew it
We stay the truest suited and booted
They ain't doin it like we do it, do it
[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's Bone Thugs, we be them Bone Thugs
Half of this industry's swingin from our baaaaalls

It's Bone Thugs, we be them Bone Thugs
Half of this industry's swingin from our baaaaalls
It's Bone Thugs, mighty Bone Thugs
Bone Thugs, Bone Bone Thuuuuugs

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Nigga tell the truth 'fore you get in the booth
You know think about the Bone flow for hoes
I ain't nice like {?} I wanna split ya mouth
Better get you that dough you old hoes
Where's the respect when you cash that check (huh?)
Nigga break bread well bust your head (yup)
I'll bring to it the heart, rather leave 'em dead
Before my time but I'm still ahead
Of all y'all (all y'all)
Like a nice bitch hit a nigga raw dawg (raw dawg)
Any nigga with him catch a sawed-off (sawed-off)
And I'm ready, I'm ready, know what it is
Nigga bow down, bow down
Nigga show some love, ain't no hoes in us
We can swing them buds, we can share some blood
Blood blood, blood blood blood blood, blood
Let a nigga loose I'mma smack him like I do (do)
I'mma come and see you, fuck that rappin in a booth (booth)
I ain't no studio or nothin my name in yo' mouth
And I'mma show you somethin, fuck it
This the first time, double back dumpin (dumpin)
Deep in the club they some suckas, rush 'em (rush 'em)
Get it how we get it, don't let the singin fool ya
We gets dirty dirty dirty
Never nervous, nah ain't no love there (ain't no love)
Just watch yo' mouth, or one day them Thuggstaz yes
They will run up on ya (on ya)
And that's when it's over cuz, we don't play no games
So when we up on ya, believe we're gonna let it rain (rain)

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
In the hood where it's good, yeah we get respect
On the industry, now it's time to bill collect
It's a promise little homie, no need for threats
We the best in the business and we breed the next
Nigga ride with a Thug on a Cleveland quest
We really ain't mad at you clones
You gotta give credit where credit is due
Why wouldn't they give it to Bone?
If you ever gave props and a massive thanks
Now you thinkin how a master think
Way back in '94, stage stayed closed
We opened the do' nigga get that bank
Flip that flow, city to city
My niggas is gritty and ol' boy
Reppin that Bone Thug, Mo Thug, Thugline
Hit 'em with one rhyme, they be like oh boy (oh boy)
Now most of the greatest done did it
And some of the latest done did it
Rest in peace to the B.I.G
Been 13 years and they still fuck wit it
Jay-Z done did it, J.D. done did it
Lil' Bow Wow did it and killed it
I love when a real nigga do they thang
Some wanna plead not guilty
Nigga get filthy, ain't no playa hation
Some of y'all niggas is congratulation
Got your hand on my dick tryin to masterbate it
Let me bust in ya face since you had to taste it
Smash and takin what's rightfully mine
Nigga better check my profile
Niggas is up in my space
Eternally this be Bone's style (Bone's style)

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's Bone Thugs, we be them Bone Thugs

S On My Chest,rap,dj khaled,2007,11980,"[Intro]
""That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead""
(Alright, alright)

[Chorus]
I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead

If youngin' say the nigga dead, then the nigga dead
If youngin' say the nigga dead, then the nigga dead

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Reporting from Kim's corner store
Hollygrove, 17th carnivore
Ridin' through the city in a Tonka toy
I got old money, coulda bought a dinosaur, huh
Only ride Chevy, never drive a Ford
And my Coupe doors open like plaza doors, yup!
Red thick women (uhh) I's adore
I'm a whore, you know that I'm a whore, yup!
Cash Money, Cash Money, monster boys
Mafia bitch! Even the cops avoid
And you say you want beef, then I got you, boy, ugh
I'll just let the Big Mac, whop' a boy
See my dreads hangin' lookin' like a rasta, boy
Fuck with my roster and I turn into Mufasa, boy, haha!
We run up in your casa, boy
And blast off like NASA, boy! Haha
[Chorus]
I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest (Yeah)
I walk, I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest

Cash Money, Ca— Cash Money
Cash Money, Ca— Cash Money
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah, Cash Money is an army nigga, better know it's gravy
If you ever fuck with Young and if you ever fuck with Baby
Shit gon' be crazy, nigga doin it like the 80's
Buncha young nigga poppin' off and they sprayin'
Up in the early, we thank Him for the sunshine
Got to get my bling on, reach for my chrome nine
Kiss mama cause we goin' out and get mines
Next nigga in line, seventeen on the grind
Shoot first, nigga not seeing mines
Big purses, million-dollar headlines
Five drops, O.G., the last Big Tyme'
Lord to the game, nigga, 'til it's my time
""Like Father Like Son,"" nigga, this time
Junior got the fame and the game, mastermind
Two hundred on the dash, nigga, watch me mash
Doing doughnuts in my hood gettin' paper bags
[Chorus]
I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Ribbon is red, that how we pledge
An Uptown C.M.B. blood 'til I'm dead
That's what I said, I'll put some change on your head
If you ever cross a line nigga it's nothin' but bread
Fifty shots I'm hot, nigga we won't stop
From puttin' candy on the slab nigga stirrin' them pots
Put the hammer on the jam nigga pull it and pops
And put the rubber on the bands nigga stackin' his knots

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Bitch I'm the boss, bih.. bitch I'm the boss
And bury me like my father on the cross
And carry thy teen, I shall over a cross
Shorty got that game on lock, like a vault
Weezy Baby, cayenne pepper, no salt
Windows down on the hog in the winter, it's yo' fault
Hehehe, I don't jump on the track, I pole vault
I got that ""S"" on my chest, man I'm supposed to ball
[Chorus]
I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest

Victory,rap,dj khaled,2010,12128,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
They doubted me all my life
Now it's victory (DJ Khaled!)

[Chorus: John Legend]
Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost
I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss
I'll put it all on the line
In a hustler's state of mind
Yeah I'm gonna make history, ohhh
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)
Ohh, victory (Victory)

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Nasir!

[Verse: Nas]
Speedboats, three tokes and pass it
Grass lit, hitting slopes in Aspen
No coat, just an oath to stay thorough 'til we back to ashes
Driven in fly sedans to the MGM Grand
Picture lots of sand, two blondes, implants, Remy in hand
We trying to tan, deal my cards with an honest hand
A modest man, aware of any counterscam
Palm trees, magnum Don Ps, LV monograms
Hottest girls flew from Rio
Mojitos, mucho frio, my libido
Sex so strong, without the E though
Hollow threats, we don't see those
Higher death toll whenever we roll, that process is pivotal
My pitiful, poverty-struck criminals will get at you
Then we lounge in a Spanish-style house
'Til it all blows over, Dolce Gabbana out
Contemplating, there is no bond with Satan
Say a little prayer for me like Aretha Franklin
For my hustlers, here's some motivation
He who has begun is half done, why you waiting?
I'm too impatient to pray, too much patience for stress
It's too much paper to rest, fuck around, you face death
I know some niggas from Astoria
That'll cut your daughter up like I used to cut a quarter up
Making all the bucks, banana clips I bought in Georgia bucks
Kill all you fucks easy, I be on the golf cart sleepy
Y'all beneath me, y'all be at the pawn shop pawning watches
Obnoxious, can't stop us, we shottas
Say you killing Pablo? Impossible, nonsense
Preposterous, bizarre at best, unfulfilled promises
I feel intelligence is my wealth, however
How enormous is Nas' pockets is a pop quiz to gossipers
See me at the Oscars looking dreamy, hood opulent
Means esoteric, how I wore it, exoticness
Makes you curious to see how serious my closet is
Shareholders wanna invest in that Nas stock, it's just
We be on that real shit, luxury four-wheel shit
Niggas acting thirst on some just-got-a-deal shit
Ha, for that victory we will kill shit
Get out the way, playboy, this is real shit

And when I take off its like I took off

Cuz errwhere I go they be like ya-yo!!

Then they look at you with that bold smile and let you know what it is, and what it ain't

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I been born & raised in the county of Dade, land of the haze, the cocaine capital
We ain't just hitting you buddy, we Warren Sapp'n you
We coming hard like them Cubans in the 80's dogg
Go ahead throw in the pot I bet its raw
Pero ten cuidado con un tumbe porque se lo llevan todo
Llamar el babalao pregunta le por un depojo
Pero final de todo tu no puede con los lobos
Everything that I do do, everything that I say say
Everywhere that I go I let 'em know ""Hey' I'm from the county of Dade""
Ol school chevy heaven, ol school niggas preachin
Young niggas wylin, getting rich off keys and violence
Trick - he's the mayor, Luke - he's the king
I'm Mr. 305 put that on a triple beam
I bet it weigh out more than a boatload of keys
Holla at them Haitians, let 'em know this lick's on me, welcome to Dade

Got a valet, can't leave mine out in these streets
Can't carpool, the crew is too deep
Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet
You should ball if you could
I be diggin in my pockets, it ain't trickin if you got it
And since a nigga from the projects
Champagne out of a can would be the fly shit
And I'm a history maker, hood motivational speaker
Rap Led Zeppelin, best-dressed list
Show you how to bubble off of large investments
Ya heard me, and this journey, I'm the journalist
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist
Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit
Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit
[Chorus: Nas & DJ Khaled]
It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck
The whole world waitin for what I'mma do next
And y'all already know where I came from
Queensbridge repper since day one
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Nasir)
Come on!

[Post-Chorus: Dre]
Out of the shadows, into the light
I have the power to take back what's mine
(Can't hide, can't hide)
We have the power
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)
We are the light

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm God's hit man, Chopard wristband
New York crown jewel, no if-and's, top five
I'm the one, two, three, four and the fifth man
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul, I'm quicksand
I'm five mics, five points of light
Hit the stage like a meteorite
They wanna all hear Ether tonight, but we ain't beefin tonight
That's history, so now when you mention me
Say I'm a mystery like six degrees
Or the seven hills of Sicily, I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me but nothin is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me
I take it a notch higher, yeah
Sip more wine than a sommelier
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here
[Chorus: Nas & DJ Khaled]
It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck
The whole world waitin for what I'mma do next
And y'all already know where I came from
Queensbridge repper since day one
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Nasir)
Come on!

[Post-Chorus: Dre]
Out of the shadows, into the light
I have the power to take back what's mine
(Can't hide, can't hide)
We have the power
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)
We are the light

[Verse 3: Nas]
Power, paper, palace is so high
Lookin over skyscrapers, wildin out in Dubai
Do I look like I never seen the better things?
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardos, the car shows
The Narcos, Gestapos, Optimos
Cause I love the dough more than you know
Still ain't reached the pinnacle
Braveheart general since nine-fo'
Got the belt to show, certified classic
Nine-six, Street Dreams was blastin
And no way they wanna hire assassins
They still harassin, I'm so platinum, it's natural
And nigga is my acronym, lights, camera, actionin
[Chorus: Nas & DJ Khaled]
It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck
The whole world waitin for what I'mma do next
And y'all already know where I came from
Queensbridge repper since day one
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Nasir)
Come on!

[Post-Chorus: Dre]
Out of the shadows, into the light
I have the power to take back what's mine
(Can't hide, can't hide)
We have the power
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)
We are the light

[Bridge: Nas]
Nigga, I'm on!
I'm on!
Come on!

Cause I'm out here grindin, hey, hey

I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Put my life on the line, but I'm likely to grind
I'm on top of the game, fuck if you like it or not
That's how I get the freaks, strawberry Swisher Sweets
You'll be dealin with H, when you dealin with G's
Now she deal with the realest, shoppin like it's still December
Diplomat on the fender of the Phantom, I'm the winner (winner)
I do it for the hood (hood) I do it cause you cain't (cain't)
You suckers wish you could, Ricky Ross is in the bank
[Verse 2: Plies]
Hey Feds, heard you're bringin my name up
Know you want me bad, think I give a fuck? (Think I give a fuck?)
Better indict me now 'fore my price go up
Came in the world thuggin, leavin with big nuts
Yeah I run with killers homie, so what?
What you want me to tell you, I sold a lil dust?
Send your informant, I bet he leave bust
I ain't scared to go, I believe in Jesus

[Hook: Akon]
I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

[Post-Hook: Lil Boosie & DJ Khaled]

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
I wake up to get my cake up, I'm out here grindin' (I'm out here grindin')
What can I say? I'm a product of my environment
Uh-oh, I'm in the game, watch me do me
Kicking these niggas, Khaled, man, call that Bruce Lee
Summer, winter, spring, I can't forget the fall
I still remain a dog, a diabetic and all
All I want is my paper, I don't care what they said
They stick they tongue out when they bow they head
'Cause we the best

[Hook: Akon]
I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)

I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Ayy, knock-knock, yeah, I'm knockin on the bank door
With a million dollars and I'm dropping off the cash flow
See, you ain't heard? I hit a lick, now my money right
Spend it on the U-Haul, dippin on the turnpike
Call up my dawgs (Dawgs), rag on my face (Face)
Bodies gon' fall (Fall), tell 'em it's Ace (Ace)
If I catch a charge, nigga, I'ma flee the state
Hit my niggas L.A. Reid and Khaled, watch me beat the case
[Verse 5: Trick Daddy]
You niggas flies—before, you was just maggots (Maggots)
I'm the shit bitch, because I'm black flaggin (Black flag)
Yessir, the DR's, the new squad
You niggas Mod Squad, we go hard
They like, ""Oh God, there go T-Double
He got his clique and his brothers, I know it's gon' be trouble""
Knock boys on the black Jags
See 'em in them black masks
No, they can't stand my Black ass

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Hahahaha, and we are the best
And Weezy be the shh like two H's after S
I got these niggas on shh like I gon deaf
And I'm right right, and your wrong left
Hahahah, check out this bizarre

If Khaled say it's a movie, then Weezy best actor

So that was my cue, ayo Fab (ey Khaled)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Shorty wanna give me the go ahead

And if I feel something I'mma try
Figured you winked at me not just something in your eye
See shawty you ain't got to tell me what I know
That was E-40 who said ""tell me when to go""
I know I got the green light, and ya'll get the red light
So if the head right I'll be there err night

Let it be house, yea the comfortable places
Married to the game on a prenuptial basis

We got a lot 'o dollars, gotta be willing to make it
And if you wanna baby might just be willing to taste it
Boss, I'm thugging and she loving it
Gotta have protect one, sipping on that bubbly
Its hard not to notice me, we known globally
Sitting on the top of the world just so comfortably

We can do that, there, just gimme the go
Been a player unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say, cheers (Let's take a toast)
No wheat or white bread in my Pillsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O
All eyes if you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties strolling all over the city

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I know you see me starin girl

Go find and it's apparent girl
You feelin luck in the street

You cool it off, and it come back rock (crack!)
Yes! I am him
Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standing on line
Black chicks is standing on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

[Chorus: Lloyd]

Konvict Muzik, oh oh
Cash Money, Young Money, let's go

[Chorus: Akon]
You already know the story
Down this road before (oh oh)
Gotta hold your breath, gotta take your time (oh oh)
If you want a taste of my life
Nothin' good comes easy
Gotta go hard, believe me
Gotta risk it all, gotta roll the dice
If you wanna taste of my life

[Post-Chorus: Akon & B.o.B]
My life, my life (My life, my life)
My life, my life (Yeah, my life, my life)
My life, my life (My life, my life)
You want a taste of my life? (Huh?)
[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, they wanna taste that rapper life
But the road of fame usually spoils the appetite
We live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife
But all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights
Huh, not everything is lavished life
But in the mirror, all I see is all the nights I had to fight
And so I run it, all I had to sacrifice
But now I got the money
I get everything for half the price
Damn

[Verse 2: Akon]
You know Khaled, everybody wants the good life
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Nobody really wanna pay the price
Ayo, ayo, ayo
No pain, no gain, na-na-na-na
This might take a little longer
No pain, no gain, na-na-na-na
It will only make you stronger

Sleep When Im Gone,rap,dj khaled,2011,8126,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
About to change the game
DJ Khaled!
We The Best Forever
Cash Money, Young Money
I'm for real about this shit
Let's go

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (Yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (Yeah)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my trash, yeah, yeah-eah (Cause time's on my side so)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 1: Game]
Yeah, they say sleep is the cousin of death, guess we related
Cause I’m the most slept on and the most hated
Hated, hated by niggas with no hustle
Staring at me in the club like I won't bust you
In the face with this Spades, life is a card game
And I'm playing Spades, gambling with y'all change
Fucking basketball wives while you at away games
Really fucking basketball wives; ain't gotta say names
Whole body tatted like a New York City freight train
Niggas get to barking, put a bullet in the Great Dane
Try me, end up like, ""Why me?""
Team full of animals like I coach the Heat
Four floor mansion, close to the beach
Six car garage, that's how I'm supposed to eat
In Miami, rolling up kush on boat decks
Flagging down the waitress, waving my Rolex
[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (Yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (Yeah)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my trash, yeah, yeah-eah (Cause time's on my side so)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, I done survive the test of time doing this shit so long
And only rest to rise again homie, I sleep when I'm gone
Look, a legend while I'm prime, so current and they hate this
The streets classified me as another level of greatness
I don't fight for crowns at all, I let wack niggas bitch
And let 'em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit
Listen, see I don't waste time debating over them things
Because I'm God motherfucker, God create kings, bust it
I'm hearing that a lot of niggas mad through the grapevine
Piano sounding beautiful and sad at the same time
The feeling at a funeral, so study you niggas
Khaled provide the theme music while I bury you niggas
See now there's no escaping the God, you better find a getaway
'Fore I start wiling like Haitians and Jamaicans when it's Labor Day
Khaled, every time you know, we gotta make 'em love it
Realize that everything is hotter when we touch it
[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (Yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (Yeah)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my trash, yeah, yeah-eah (Cause time's on my side so)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 3: Game]
Ayo, Khaled let this shit breathe
Spoiled little rich nigga, that's me
Smoke blowing out the sunroof, blowing on hashish
Can't stop now cause I'm in too deep
One point five wired every two weeks
Niggas wanna kill me, let the shells fall out
Life insurance and plates, my kids gon' ball out
They kids gon' ball out, twenty years from now, pulling cars out
You gon' think cocaine getting hauled out
X getting shipped in
Crystal meth getting dipped in all cause you let a nigga slip in
Aftermath, '05, G-Unit, '06
Everything else is gymnastics, watch the dough flip
Sitting on the couch, smoking up memories
Pouring Jack Daniels, toast to my enemies
Fuck beef, nigga, I ain't got the energy
Take the last shot to the dome, John Kennedy
[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (Yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (Yeah)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my trash, yeah, yeah-eah (Cause time's on my side so)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone

I’m On One,rap,dj khaled,2011,1320886,"[Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib,  T-Minus, and Nikhil ""Kromatik"" Seetharam]

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Drake]
I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (I said, ""I’m on one"")
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ugh, I'm getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like, ""What's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me""
And, ""What's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking—watch me take it
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody should've told you

[Chorus: Drake]
I’m on one, yeah
Fuck it, I'm on one, yeah
I said, ""I'm on one""
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple or could be pink
'Pending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one
I said, ""Fuck it, I'm on one""

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Huh! I'm burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest (Huh)
I bury the most cash and burning the rest (Stuntin')
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air (Yeah)
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear (Check it)
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, ""Everything is great"" (Right)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing eight
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully (Haha)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams (Woo!)
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? (Woo!)
Huh! Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So, yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double MG until I get the chair, chyeah
[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Rick Ross]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from (Huh)
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody should've told you

[Chorus: Drake]
I’m on one, yeah
Fuck it, I’m on one, yeah
I said ""I’m on one""
Fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple or could be pink
'Pending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one
I said, ""Fuck it, I’m on one""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money ain't enough money
You know the feds listening—nigga, what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused, might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sellout, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration, bitches: Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall: Olive Oyl
""Tunechi"" be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killing these hoes, I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
All I care about is money (Yeah) and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody should've told you

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
I’m on one, yeah (Young Mula, baby)
Fuck it, I’m on one (YMCMB)
Yeah, I said, ""I’m on one"" (Uh-huh)
Fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple or could be pink
'Pending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one (Haha)

It Aint Over Til Its Over,rap,dj khaled,2011,4443,"[Intro: DJ Khaled & Jadakiss]
DJ, DJ, DJ Khaled! (Ah-hah!)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I said we the best at making this green
I swear Mountain Dew ain't got nothing on my team
F is for the family that’s holding me down
I think niggas know who run this town
A is for the action I’m all about
Blow a nigga head off, kill all the doubt
B is for the big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money
Shots of 'Tron at like 4 in the morn'
It ain't over til it’s over, Loso I'm gone

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
The lights stay on, they don't fade
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Take my last call, don’t hold your breath
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Everyday make something outta nothing
Move a mountain and still keep running
Never come down, make no mistakes
[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
They can say, ayy, ooh, that my end is on the horizon
When I wake, ooh, all I see is the sun rising
Just when I thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word, it ain't over til it's over
Just when I thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I smoke weed, you sip on lean
People always sayin’ what the hell does that mean
J is for the justice I did to the game
Lot of these niggas that's on is lame
A is for the way I airs 'em out
Coupes by the two’s I pairs 'em out
D's for the dope that a nigga still pumping
Twelve hour shifts got the spot still jumping
Rocking on til the block is gone
.38 is snubnosed but the chopper's long

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
And everything takes time so they say
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
What has been on my side everyday
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Every second gone is another way to come up
Bend the corner, crash into the jackpot
Twists and turns I can take
[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
They can say, ayy, ooh, that my end is on the horizon
When I wake, ooh, all I see is the sun rising
Just when I thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word, it ain't over til it's over
Just when I thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh

If you ain't talkin' money, we ain't talkin'
This is DJ Khaled, Lex Luger

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I can’t even walk (Why?) my pockets too heavy
Got that .40 on me now (Why?) them choppers too heavy
Told him, ""You gotta fall back, I can't sneak you in the club""
He said, ""I'm in the car, you need me, my nigga?"" Nothing but love
Now it's blunts everywhere, so much smoke, I can't see ya
Ain't over here, look, I wouldn't wanna be ya
Talking so many bitches, we got bitches on bitches
Way she moving that ass, I think the bitch got switches
Pull up to this bitch, Escalade full of killers
The only thing realer, Escalade full of scrilla
Louis V to the back, half a rack for the snapback
Wiz Khalifa's on the coupe, I'm talking black and yellow flapjacks

[Chorus: Jeezy]
When I talk, I be talkin' 'bout money
So please don't talk to me if you ain’t talkin' 'bout money
Weed, blow, ecstasy, nah, we talkin' 'bout money
Don’t know what's wrong with me cause I be talkin' 'bout money
We talkin' bout money, let the money talk (Money)
Let the money talk (Money) let the money talk (Money)
Let the money talk (Money) let the money talk (Money)
Let the money talk (Money) let the money talk (Money)
Let the money talk (Money)
[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Hahahaha, Luda!
I’m talkin' 'bout money you never seen, ho
The Incredible Hulk, so much paper, I'm turning green, ho
Green Giant, I want it, I buy it
Y'all just ballers on a budget (Fuck!) your money's on a diet
I'm laughing, you such a riot, David vs. your Goliath
Let my money talk for me, hear 'em (Shhh) be quiet
Hamilton said, ""What's happenin'?"" Jackson said, ""What it do?""
Grant chucked up a deuce, my Benjamin said, ""Fuck you!"" (Ah)
It cost money to fund a war nigga (Ah)
I'll have you laying right on the floor nigga
And take you higher, I'm a lover, not a fighter
But if a rapper's gettin gassed then I'm the first with a lighter

[Chorus: Jeezy]
When I talk, I be talkin' 'bout money
So please don't talk to me if you ain’t talkin' 'bout money
Weed, blow, ecstasy, nah, we talkin' 'bout money

Future,rap,dj khaled,2011,32965,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
I am the streets, the future
I introduce you to Ace Hood, Meek Millz, Big Sean
Wale, Vado, this the future
They getting money, they making hit records
They hustling

[Verse 1: Ace Hood & DJ Khaled]
Okay now Khaled told me kill em (Kill em)
He just told me kill em (Kill em)
Hundred for the Beamer, kudos for the dealer
Murder bet I wrote her, kudos to the killer
Chevy sitting crooked, teeth on Reggie Miller
I'm a motherfucking beast, see me in your sleep
Nightmare on any street, swear I will murk any beat
Spread this to the industry, lyrics like the chopper piece
Flow right through your fitted T, pull this loot with chemistry
Hottest nigga 'round, they saying greatness is my tendency
No such thing as sympathy, more money my remedy
Pockets on Heavy D, bitch I'm hot, third degree
Whip I drive, owned by me, wrists and neck, anti-freeze
Can it be I'm who you dying to be?
Last of a dying breed, talking Siamese
Twin pistol shooter nigga like a 7B
Big dog getting it, you still on your pedigree
Yeah, fly nigga with some stupid swag
Dead faces keep my money in a body bag
And I'm G-U-T-T-A, hops in the whip and I gotta get paid
Fuck them bitches, ain't tryna get laid
Walk in my house you can meet my maid
Any given day you can push that Lac
Push that Benz on, push that 'Lade
Hopped in the whip, no top on mine
Niggas gonna hate, man fuck them guys
Real nigga shit, don't tell no lie
Private plane, my seat recline
Top ten charts where I reside
Got me a house, about to sign, nigga
[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly
We the motherfucking best, word to my mama
Ridin' presidential got me feeling like Obama
Cause all I want is change and my niggas they wanted the same
I wanted the money and never the fame
I turned into something they never became
Through all that rain, I kept my flame
And I kept burning and it's my turn and
Real nigga, my hood confirm it, now it's 6-2's on closed curtains
And that Maybach, let me take 'em way back, when I was starving
Now it's payback, nigga where that cake at? Murder all your artists
And I, I, I, I can feel that love, I can feel that hate
When I got that drum, I just feel so safe
I put it to your mug and it ain’t gonna wait
From this lil '08 when that thing gon fly
Got a little kick but it ain't no tired
Niggas talk murder but they ain't gon ride
Now we going hard like I ain't gonna die
Meek Mill

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Boi, boi, do it, okay, okay, smoke until I ain't got no lungs
Got her going down, no teeth, I call it speaking tongues
(Do it, do it) Now you speaking my language
From when they twist and talk with they fingers
Man but this ain't no sign language
Just fresh out of the ashes, this a Detroit fucking classic
From when MM got the masses, and Trick Trick got them passes
Bitch I'm from the Motor, Motor, yeah, that motor be the fastest
Bitch, they call it Motor City cause you're most likely to crash
Fuck it, good thing I got a chauffeur (Chaffeur)
Going broke? (Going broke?) No sir (No sir)
Bitch I'm the rap game stylist (Boi)
Cause I gave the rap game style, bitch
But I overshine, ain't no niggas over Sean
Toll rollin' five quarters so I guess we going overtime
'Til we dumb high (Dumb high) dumb high (Dumb high)
Westside, bitch I run mine
I'm rolling around in my old school, I feel like the alumni
Fuckin' hoes, no strings attached
So don't ask me why they strung out
I'm like Jordan to you niggas, I might even stick my tongue out
She wiggled and wobble, bobbled then landed on my throttle
Bitch, I might make you my baby and even buy you a bottle
Your niggas don’t ask how the top feel
When you keep 'em right beside you
My pockets got paper on paper, this shit just look like a novel
Boi, hundred thousand worth of ice on me now
But it don't feel half as good as grandma saying she proud
[Verse 4: Wale]
Forever dedicated, Maybach poetic genius
Some think they close to seein' me, tell 'em they close to Stevie
You poser niggas ain't 'posed to be here, we don't believe ya
Double MG up, we put a wreath on niggas' career
We the best, Khaled, no need to stress, Khaled
Know there's a lot of artists, but I got the best palette
Multiple colors, my mind is more productive than others
Married to Winnie, he think he really Nelson Mandela
That's fire though, one time for the 305 though
That hydro make me tired, yo, my kick game be so Tae-Bo
My balance be so tight rope, that's hard to find, Quick Tri-Flow
Can't fuck with me, that dyke flow, hoes blow for me, I maestro
Shit, that white whip sit like a slight wrist slit
Suicide shit, you can by shit if you write this shit
Nigga and right this minute, they say I'm buzzing hard
My driver's out of this world, you playing bumper cars
You niggas under cars, you should be unemployed
All you smokers Reggie, I'm in the telly, bunch of noise
Who gon' tell me that I ain't going or I ain't flowing?
Young Folarin, you see them 'puters, that was my influence

[Verse 5: Vado]
The Towers fell (Uh-huh), turned to Ground Zero
Kids ain't like Reggie Jackson, Nicki Barnes their hero
As I play Rothstein, Corleone like Bob De Niro
Been through it, we're here though, don't move with the weirdos (Woo)
Dress pimp, make a toast like, ""Let's win""
Penthouse is on West and Fourth, pipes and MAC-6
While we in a Maserati brickin' his best friends
When I die, tell 'em to turn my coffin to stretch Benz (Just like this)
Rims on it, problems, my mans on it (I see em')
See him, we stomp him out, his mouth, our Timbs on it (Yes)
Always smoking an ounce amount, no tens on it (No)
Spins on it, you have no clout depends on it (What)
What the fiends say, few roaches you need spray
On tours, we straight, making sure lawyer fees paid (I got em')
Get the bills due, Mildew SRT-8
Charcoal seats gray, drop tops like release dates

A Million Lights,rap,dj khaled,2011,5137,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Believe that, it's DJ Khaled
It's that We The Best, YMCMB
We The Best Forever

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
A million lights and a kick drum
The floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one
And we still young, you know, oh, oh?
I'm breathing fire in your club
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uhh, new Hermes duffle bags
On the plane, see the sky through a little glass
20 hour flight, never jet-lagged
Sipping white wine, watching the sunset
Real love this close I ain't never had
Sitting with you all day 'til the night pass
Damn, damn, ain't tryna fight that
But if we fall too fast, will the feeling last?
Now I'm looking over my shoulder
Shoulder, uhh
Champagne, good dimes and good times
And now it's all over
But can't blame me for all that
You was bright, now your heart all black
Tryna outshine the good with the bad
You a cold muh'fucker, I ain't mad at you
Hah, I'm still shining
[Hook: Kevin Rudolf & Mack Maine]
A million lights and a kick drum
The floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one
And we still young, you know, oh, oh?
I'm breathing fire in your club
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
We The Best, YMCMB baby
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
Bitch I'm Ma-, bitch I'm Ma-, bitch I'm
B-b-b-bitch I'm Mack Mai-i-i-i-ine

[Verse 2: Mack Maine & Jae Millz]
Okay, you getting old and your heart turn cold
Timeline froze, mad at the world
Cause you lived your life but this the life that we chose
Lights on the road for the nicest Rolls
I mean long ass flights for these trifling hoes
But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled
I mean no life, low life
Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live your life
Lame ass nigga, you cook it with no spice
Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like
Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend
Leo Lion the king, I'm looking for a dope queen
A First Lady baby, Young Money's Barack
Baggy cargos, high mismatched socks
Me, Gunz, Millz, Tyga, we give em the chills (Millzy!)
Weak riders get birth control pills, Young Money
[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Uhh, bright lights
Lord knows I live for these nights
You're damn right
I'ma sip champagne 'til it blur my sight
Yanks fitted cap to the front like Jeter
And my diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of Cheaters, Jesus
Loud jewelry, loud speakers
Blowing loud weed with some loud divas
Millz!

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf & Cory Gunz]
A million lights and a kick drum
The floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one
And we still young, you know, oh, oh?
I'm breathing fire in your club
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, Khaled

[Verse 4: Cory Gunz]
Uh, it's that summertime money time
Gonna rhyme good time, want a dime, gimme mine
Loud smoke, quiet engine out the city line
Pretty toes hanging out the window to the finish line
Spikes poking out my kicks like a porcupine
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, fall in line
Uptown thoroughbreded from the South Bronx
Hot blocks in Miami, Khaled outcome
You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest
Life nothing like a movie, I just day-to-day this
Remember it was hard tryna pay his wages
Now he spitting hard rhymes on the main stages
Independent, yeah I told 'em, ""Major later""
We some independent niggas getting major paper
Shout Tune, Stunna, Slim, Mack
We play for keep shorty, how we gon' give up that
YMCMB, lights, camera, action!

Police kicked my door and shorty last night
I'd be damned if I don't go out without a fight
My girlfriend says she needs some new shoes in a bag
I tell her shut the fuck up and get off yo ass (Brick Squad)
I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin'
I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin'
Middle fingers to the cops and the judge (Flocka)

God bless a niggas soul, bitch I'm out here
Wear the wrong color, you can't come around here
So get your mind right, and keep your pistol close
Hoppin' out that ride out into your face, just like a seminal
I'm a nigga, stay thuggin', my lil' cousin got his chopper chrome
And a nigga want problems, take your top off like a metro dome
And make a loud noises, sound like it's world war
And never break a sweat, that's what them killers for
I get money ho, on some real shit
Deck 100's on me, that's just what I deal with
Waka's thugged out, and we the business
See me fuck the hammer, bet your niggas feel quick
Mama pray for me, commit a lot of sins
And it don't make it better consumin' a lot of gin
Blood, sweat & tears, I put my soul out
Smell the flowers, bitch, I might just pull the rose out

Now where my niggas who be thuggin' on the corner for it? (Yuh)
Hands in the air, throw your hood up
Hoppin' off that 7 trey sixes when I pull up
Now where my bad bitches, who keep that ass fat?
I love a hood bitch, ain't scared to throw that ass back
And I keep them real niggas, homie that's that
You a super duck, I'm talkin' Aflac
My niggas stormed out, stormed out
Stupid dress in them zones with that stone mouth (Bow)
Club stupid packed, it's a mad house
Catch you sniffin' by yourself, and then you assed out (Brrt)
And homie that's word, my niggas gon' learn
See that red in blue, I'm runnin' out my Converse

The definition: I'm clutchin' on my slippin in
The way I'm feelin' right now, a bitch could get the business
Just know my niggas squeeze on side
Only problem is we doin this head knock
I told Ross, ""we gon show em how the Gutta do""
All black skis, black ones and the jumpsuit
Silde in the silder in and out night vision
Scopes on the AR to hit em with precision
And did I mention this one here’s for the thugs dummy
A little drugs bunny; we did it off of blood money
More pieces of Crown Vic surround us
We runnin up on niggas, they jumpin off of counters
One time for my allies
I’m a poe boy that like my guns, supersize
CMB what it is

See the way we get the cake, like everyday's a boring day
Blood money, and I’ma count it till they come for me
The feds hate it, they mistakin me for Blanco Buddies
I’m puttin blood, sweat and tears for this cash money
I’m talkin crooked unidentified bags of it
I’m talkin yellow table paper; put the tags on it
You play with mine, bet I turn you into crash dummies
Better not need heaters, I spit them shells like the beatles
I have my people go see you, I squash you out like a cheater nigga
I'm for that drug money underneath the rug money
My niggas love money, yeah, I’m talking blood money

Well I’m the mob chief, given orders, callin' all the shots out
Make a nigga understand: we gangstas, we don’t play out
Came from under the sand, lift my own weight up
Bought a house off the curb, was patient so it paid up
No pleasure and pain homie, just the price for the flight
Don’t get’cha head chopped fuckin' with them five stripes
Eagle land it went south, now we got the cake
Paper plate money, every time I hitch a state
High on this pressure life, famous from the mud
Got the game from some old heads, I took it up in Blood
Yeah the only price nigga is a price
A mill on some whips, a hundred on ya life

Aight, this record right here is featuring the future!
Ace Hood, Kendrick Lamar
One time for the West Coast! (Olympicks!)
Philly, what's up?

[Intro (Kiss the Ring): DJ Khaled]
Yeah, it's We The Best!
It's YMCMB!
One time for Top Dawg Entertainment!
(Olympicks!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about it, make 'em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like it's livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet
Lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga, play yo' part or parallel park yo' ego
Next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it
Or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a MAC
In the back of a 'Lac with a latch on the back
Of the trunk, hit a punk in the back with the pump
In the back 'til he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop, wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block, he watch with a block
Or whatever and cut, no cut, mo' guns, mo' guts, fuck boy
You fucked up twice, you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip head first smilin'
Cr-cry in the face of Jesus, we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches, TDE, YMCM, big business, bitch!
[Interlude: Ace Hood]
Ace Hood
Birdman, what they do, big dawg?
Mack Maine, what's crackin fool?
Big money!

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay nigga, riding in a May-B, and I'm probably with Baby
Don't talk nigga, fuck you, pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay, big money on this side
100 grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new safe, money getting too high
Dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up, she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, two shows a day
My Rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do, Bird? My fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy, easy, outta control
[Interlude: Birdman]
Just like that boy
Death forbids honor, ya understand me?
Dedication, respect
Fully loaded, yeah

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand Persian rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fishscales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been, shining on them 24’s
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho, while he doing time ho

[Interlude: Mack Maine]
Ya know, that time is money
And money still was made baby
Eight months ain't stop nothing, nigga
It’s like, jail was third base
And my lil' nigga still came home, ya understand? Yeah
[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up, damn, they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and Fail Boy
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can't withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand (Young Money!)
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole 'nother tax bracket
Amen

[Outro (Billionaire Minds): DJ Khaled]

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Reputation for Gs, that's the role of a boss
So amazin' to see, black baguettes in my watch
She say love is for free, just expensive to shop
But it's nothin' to me, uh, that extends from my block (Ugh!)
I got a lot of figures, yeah, I'm a father figure (Me)
She know a lot of niggas, don't know a hotter nigga (Ha!)
Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I'm here to nurture (For real), I wanna take you further
She got all them purses, I say in my verses
YSL and Hermès and barely scratch the surface (Ugh!)
She know on purpose (Ugh!), as I peel the curtains
I always make her nervous (Ugh!), this record's perfect

Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island

On My Way,rap,dj khaled,2010,11065,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
I'm on my way
This goin' out to every hood
We gonna make it

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
(Hey) You can look into my eyes
See that I'm getting tired
6:00 in the morning
Money still on my mind
So if you want it
I'm the one to supply
Be there in no time (no time, no time)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way

[Verse 1: Bali]
Nigga this legendary, no ordinary shit
No ordinary bitches, no ordinary whips
4 bills nigga special like they 30
I come along way from food stamps and section 8
Niggas eatin' on these beats get yourself a plate
And I'm a step away, one hit a breath away
When you don't got time, you ain't never late
Come so Victory is here we can celebrate
[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Ok, I'm on my grizzle, on my grind
Go ahead try, top my shine
I'm on my way, any day
Tell them niggas better have my cake
What you think, nigga you ain't
Have me laughing all the way to the bank
L O L, A M B, O R at the Gini baby
Had the chop the top off that bitch
Just so they can see me baby
Money I get, know that shit
Yeah he paid, notice it
Sleeping who, no can do
Motivation, ocean view
How I get it bitch you tripping
Ain't got nothing to do with you

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]

Be there in no time (no time, no time)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
[Verse 3: BallGreezy]
Victory is on the way
Khaled go in on 'em
Show 'em we gonna win homey
Get off in their skin homey
I've been getting in the streets over 10 years
So you think a nigga pussy cause his ear's pierced
Run up on a nigga pussy if you want to
You gotta best be sure that it go through
BallGreezy gettin' money like he 'posed to
Good dope in the drop like soul food
Big Body, big rims on the old school
Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed too
Lights off, click clack in the pinto
Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo
5% DBs on the Renzo
No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done

[Verse 4: Iceberg]
It's like I always say motherfucker here I come
Another victory for the crib a couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fucking job
Cause I'm taking everything except a loss Iceberg goes off
Yeah 24/7 I goes on and I be scared I might miss money, so I don't doze off
I'm a snap and the streets know it, Trick told me keep going
An I'm a keep chiefin as long as god keep the weed growing

I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way

[Verse 5: Desloc]
Switch man been to official, I've been destined to shine
Won't take no for an answer, fuck nigga gimme mine
Never been selfish for real, I put on my whole city
I went from standing on corners to autographin' titties
My daddy gave my Virginia's King, A Richmond legend
A wise speaker, a woman pleaser, broke nigga, reverend
Mr O 10, I get it in, I wear the crown
We the best, tell 'em fuck next, I got downs

[Verse 6: Gunplay]
You got the cash? Then show me, better not be phoney
Get on my level cause they way below me
You ballin? Bologna. Girls ask me what my cologne is
Steel Khakis and Coronas and I'm mackin' a donkey
Flip the 4 and a half, do the vert and a left
Bet the ave never seen banks chunky as that
Why you got pressure? Cause my Impala got pressure
Beating outside, shaking the dice on my dresser. Is that Gunplay, Yes sir

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]

[Verse 7: Rum]
Yes, I'm on my way, all the way to the top, but I comin' from the bottom
You right here ain't go no brain, uh-uh, can't stop 'em
Headin' to the floor, I'm ridin'
Where the money keep most supplyin'
You can tell I'm stickin' like a muthafucker by the way I'm vibing
Just came back from where I was On my way somewhere else next
Lightening wrapped up in around my bankroll make my money spent
You can check up over here, check up over there Spent my hustle everywhere
I'm high-head grinding, getting it I'm everywhere, you're never there

[Verse 8: Young Cash]
It's Young Cash, I rap and I sing, nigga
Still a goon, I rap under you rappers for your chain, nigga
Fuck the alcohol, I'm the one they're playing, nigga
Black is the attire when I roll up with that thing, nigga
I'm riding flow, but I don't wanna move in quarter keys
I come from Texas, if you're Georgia just to fuck with me
Gimme your order, buy them more then, dog, I guarantee

I Wish You Would,rap,dj khaled,2012,269667,"[Intro: DJ Khaled & Rick Ross]
DJ Khaled!
Hit-Boy! (Huh)
I’m so serious! (Woo)

[Intro Verse: Kanye West & DJ Khaled]
One, two, them boys coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They said ""thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real""
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon' be our year, every year gon' be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In God We Trust
We believe in God, but do God believe in us?
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen
[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I’ve been poppin' shit for too long
But still reppin’ where I came from
I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
Ay, I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us
Maybach Music

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Hunh! My money on a another level
In the streets out here I'm hotter than the fucking devil
I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel
G5, make it rain, I can change the weather
We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle, consider ‘em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting
Hunh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only things truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
God Forgives and I Don’t, pussy niggas on notice
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
Ay! I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
You see you got a couple cases, still look good nigga
You see these niggas’ll try to play ya, know how ya feel nigga
Eh yup, that’d be the day you wanna kill a nigga
But you gon' chill nigga, just for your kids nigga
Cause now there’s kids doing grown man biz nigga
You just got home nigga, you tryna live nigga
You don’t wanna do another 5 years nigga
The boss is testing yo ass, the feds’ll question yo ass
They be drug testin’ yo ass and then they pray you don’t pass
And then you look in the sky, you got some questions to ask
With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I’ve been poppin shit for too long
But still reppin’ where I came from
I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
Ay! I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us

[Hook: Schife]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!

If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Where they at?
Put em up!

If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Put em up!

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Say Khaled I'm going in so you can gon' bring in back
Gon' bring it back, I said gon' bring it back! (Ey!)
A straight monster in this bitch
Nigga, poltergeist
It's Dade County in this verse, they gon' say Jesus Christ
And like Rihanna fine ass, I'm gon' live my life
Ten bands and take one, call it being nice
Get your hands up and that's a direct order
Got my bands up, thanks to the transporter
Thanks to the transporter?
I'm like yeah sorta!
Got my name hot, be around like South Florida
Get your hands up if your not living right
Now keep your hands up
You risk it err'day and night
[Hook: Schife]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!

[Verse 2: Plies]
If I die tonight, bury me in the hood
With all the jewelry on, make sure I'm looking good
Rob who nigga? I wish a nigga would
Point 5, don't shoot, that's how the lames do it
Word on the street somebody put a hit on me
I'm in the foreign, top off, look like I'm worried homie?
Better send them now, got bout a mill on me
You rob me; I kill you, now that's a deal homie
Two-twenty-three
Carbon one-five
Old black bitch with me, that's that forty five
Been real, never snitched nigga my whole life
Heard a nigga whacked him
He shouldn't have testified
[Hook: Schife]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!

If you know this how you living, put your hands up!

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm hotter than a Kawasaki in the projects
Burning more than rubber, money ain't a object
I'm number 1, and hurt they feelings in the process
Cop a bird, then your really seein progress
I'm buying cars like I'm in a contest
Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat
I'm the winner, these beginners talking nonsense
Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small
[Hook: Schife]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Where they at?

If you know this how you living, put your hands up!

Shout Out to the Real,rap,dj khaled,2012,20596,"[Intro: DJ Khaled & Meek Mill]
Ahh
DJ Khaled
Yeah
Meek Milly
Yo, turn the music up a little bit
We The Best
Yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Free Boosie, real nigga
In the jail standing tall like Shaquille nigga
I used to say, ""I know how you feel, nigga""
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Had my hood hating, I done came up
I don’t know if it’s the money or the fake stuff
Got me walking through the jungle with my flame tucked
Got around my juries since they want to see me chained up
Friends turn to foes when you're in a Rolls
Model bitches turn to hoes cause a nigga froze
Got them people taking pictures, let a nigga pose
Cause I get paid for reading scripts, been getting shows
Poppin' bottles it sound like a Mac-10
Phantom be so big, beep when I back in
I dropped a quarter milli on an Aston
And I ain’t got an album, but I got these niggas balling out
I’m gone
[Chorus: Meek Mill & DJ Khaled]
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job-
Ace Hood

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Yeah, bought a chopper for my problems, that banana type
Seen a millie, now it’s hard for me to sleep at night
I’m the type to flood the rollie like it's New Orleans (woo)
Bet that all my niggas ball like I’m Mr. Clean
From the bottom to the top, I made it out the gutter
I’m 17 on every scene I need my bread and butter (butter)
Used to run the streets, but now I’m running every summer (summer)
Right back on my bullshit like a Chicago lover
Feel like I'm jumping up out that phantom on my cocky ass
Know they hating, I just tell 'em kiss the paper tags
Still be with them pretty bitches, save for Stacy Dash
Plus my rollie cost me 80, that's gon' make 'em mad
Free my niggas locked, free my nigga caged
Fuck the system yeah you know we on the same page
Niggas love it when you're drowning in that water, dawg
Hate to see a nigga shining like some Armor All
Loyalty over royalty that’s my common law
We The Best: the logo, and I'm with my fucking boss (Khaled)
He just tell me murder niggas would think of Holocaust
Kill the hottest young'n in and what you niggas thought
[Chorus: Meek Mill, Plies, & DJ Khaled]
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute) (Ace, what up)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to-
Plies

[Verse 3: Plies]
They took a half a M nigga, out the bank nigga
If you want to whip 'em pussy nigga, blank nigga
And I put that red dot right where you think nigga
Hood nigga still wearing cuban linx nigga
I’m on the ave. nigga riding in a cutlass
You that talking nigga, you know you a pussy
A real nigga, real life, no rap shit
And I can promise you this ain’t what you want, bitch
30 mill and I still ain't been to LIV nigga
‘Cause I was to busy to gutter with the real niggas
When you see me in the field tell me how you feel nigga
And we some kids to each other if you real nigga
And they ain’t telling none of my young nigga to chill, nigga
We all shooters, nigga, and all us on the pills nigga
Ain’t got a yacht, but nigga the size of Shaquille, nigga
And before you try me nigga you better write your will, nigga
[Chorus: Meek Mill]

Turn up!
Ya not hear me
I said ""Turn up!!"" (Mike will Made-It)
Woo!
Bitches and bottles
You know what is it
Ay, DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Future & T.I.]
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles (Okay!)
Bitches and bottles, (Hustle Gang my nigga) let's get it started (Let's hear what I got, ay)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I’m turned up 'til my knob broke, you say
""Turn it down,"" I say, ""Nah ho""
My neck rocky like Balboa, my watch official, it's uncalled for
In the St. Regis on all floors, I got six sluts on all fours
They french kissin', say bonjour
I got my own shine but I want yours
I’m stupid rich, got stupid bitch, who stupid thick in Louboutin
Don’t like me, fuck you again, wanna fight me, well come do it then
Right hand to God on everything, I see the hearts of men and they very lame (Okay)
I won’t entertain no punk shit, they talk shit and I run shit
Boy, you tryin’ to get what I been here (Been here)
Held it down for like ten years (Ten years)

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: J Cole]
And you know it don't stop, grindin' 'round that clock
Masterminding my second album, my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down
Niggas thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops, ha
And we still duckin' cops, ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggas know I'm takin' they spot
'Cause that score up on the play clock show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you—ASAP; but you niggas rappin' like Aesop, Aesop, get a grip!

[Pre-Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas
[Chorus: J. Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world: twice, to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever! Ha
They say they ready for whatever

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yuh, yuh, Young Krizzle
Shawty look what we got (we got), my bass beat and it knock (It knock)
Got the old school in my old school was to post up on your block (Your block)
Yo broad chose like she was s'posed to and you up in arms 'cause she bopped (She bopped)
Cole I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop (Whoa)
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin' doors on they drop (Whoa)
Y'all niggas too young to remember how to the South used to be, but I'm not (Whoa)
So when it come to snappin', Cadillacs, SpottieOttieDopaliscious, y'all pop (Whoa)
You thought Krit Wuz Here and R4 were the shit? Bitch, wait 'til my album drop (Get 'em girls)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Say that's your new car? Nigga, that's my old slab
Say that's your new bitch? Nigga, that's my old stab
Oh that's yo new flow? That shit sound so trash
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Hol' up...but don't forget about Compton, nigga!
One for the money, two for the show
Three for No Limit and the rest for Death Row
That means I been 'bout it 'bout it and this is the realest shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it, then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute
And that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul
I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor, I'm needing your lips, yeah
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it, then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right, when I floor it, that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, ugh, keeping one foot in your anus, ugh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, ugh
Bitch I'm demanding respect, these bitches is telling me, ""Take it""
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holding the torch ain't no challenge, ain't it? Ooh, huhuhu

[Chorus: J. Cole]
One for the money, two for the show

Fat asses, big bottles
When I’m around they both get poppin’
I talk about girls and money
Too much I admit, way too much girls
Too much money, those 2 things that don’t exist
And I think It's so impressive I’m riding in the back
Young and black ’cause I’m chauffeured and not ’cause I’m arrested
Getting richer every year, yeah congrats to my progression

If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then
The niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screaming my name, I’m repping my city

So fuck what the lames about wouldn't be
No game without us no game without us

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This shit's special

J.U.S.T.I.C.E League

[Verse 1: Scarface]
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories—she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind, so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now, the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to kill you
I built my whole life around you
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel? I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the Sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone, you don't look at it the same, man
Fuck love, 'cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood, but I'm still here
Hip-hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s, plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let you—
Get away, now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the colleges, professors
Now, I regret the day I met ya (Bitch)
I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked hip-hop
[Verse 2: Nas]
And if— And if— And if— And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today, I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap—to this bitch, you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave
You won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her Vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love—word up, right on
You know how girls are
She love when you licking on her WorldStar
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings
Made some friends resent me for writing about my life
They thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would've never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, ugh, hallowed be Thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her, used to ride her—for dollars, not for fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second
Then, I screamed, ""She's dead!""
And everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her—she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck hip-hop
[Scratch Outro 1: DJ Premier]
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would I give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit
I fucked hip-hop
And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most I can give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
I fuck hip-hop
And you all know how the story go

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]

I did it for my dawgs, Maybach Music (I did it for my dawgs)
Oh Lord!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Hundred in the mula got more diamonds than a jeweler
Top down on the car, might be riding with a shooter (Woop)
Nigga down to do ya, I ain't fucking with a curl bar
Nickel-plated Ruger have you in a box on Worldstar
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga, duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Where I’m from you're called a fuck nigga
Pistol in the freezer, spend a kilo on the visa
Courtside, SportsCenter, I can make you a believer (Swish)
Everybody going broke, keep it real, you gotta fight it
Hundred kilos in the Bimmer, boy don’t make me get excited
Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted
Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger, huh
Real niggas, taking over televisions (Huh)
Dope boys riding in a new set of Benzes
Hot boy, Young boy, still on fire
What’s a death sentence cause we all gotta die
[Chorus: Rick Ross, French Montana & Meek Mill]
I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Sittin’ on them M’s, mad shit is gettin realer
Ricky's diesel got my hood looking like it's Thriller
Buying all these foreigns I be in and out the dealer
Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin, it could kill ‘em
And these suckas, I don’t feel ‘em
I don’t even see ‘em
I’mma die fly, Rest in Peace Aaliyah
Half my dawgs dead, the rest of them is here
If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon believe ya
Said I did it for my dawgs, did it for my dawgs
Everybody ridin’ till you sit ‘em in the morgue
Started with a Bonne now I’m sittin’ in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me
Shit, you looking at a boss
Rose gold rolie on my wrist, flawless
Hundred bottles send ‘em to the vip, ballin’
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding
Ya’ll niggas talking, fuck is yall retarded?
[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs)
(Haaa) I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs)

(Haaaan) I did it for my dawgs, (I did it for my dawgs)
Oh Lord!

[Verse 3: French Montana]
I did it for my dawgs (Woo)
Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss
Did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt
Now I’m in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the coffin
Got price on my head, I'm in a drop top 'rari
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning
My dawg doing life, try to see him ‘fore he hit the coffin’ (Haan)
Play with my paper, run up in your offices
It’s the ’012 Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat
A maniac nigga, where the paper at
Highway to life, need a hundred mill exit (Woo)
50 on the wrist, hundred on the necklace
(Montana)

[Chorus: Rick Ross, French Montana, Ace Hood, and Jadakiss]
I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs)
(Woah!) (Uhh-huh) I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs) (Ace Hood)
(Dawgs) I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs)
(Haaaan) I did it for my dawgs, (Oh Lord) (I did it for my dawgs)
Oh Lord!
[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Ok I did it for them niggas who they lockin' in them jail cells
Go to court they under oath they never tattle tale
Tired of countin money bitch I went and bought a scale
Homie caught a case I put a quarter on the bail
Look my brothers keeper, sleeping with the reaper
Rims on the jeep sittin higher than Khalifa
Its that black boy sleeves tatted, dreadlocks, fuck cops
Ridin with the burner turn your shirt into a tank top
20 chains on you would think I'm in a headlock
Everything foreign like I grew up on a spain block
Nigga, what the fuck you talkin bout
Broward county nigga did it for the whole block
Huuuuuh

[Chorus: Rick Ross, French Montana, Jadakiss, and Rick Ross & Jadakiss]
I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs)

(Ahh-haa) I did it for my dawgs, (Uhh, yeah)
Oh Lord!

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
Yo, watch who you drinking with
Watch who you smoking with
1.7 in my safe when I open it (Cash)
If I put 7 in ya face, will I open it?
And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is
Love to get acquanted with you
Stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dawgs so I had to put the bails up (Yeah)
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up
Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut (Uh)
Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt
Yeh the pills is flying but the smokers is something else
If the spot catch fire, the coke will just really melt (Ahh)
The dough got ‘em bringing in the broads (Come on)
Obvious the flow got ‘em screaming for the lord (Lord)
If there’s money on ya head, what you think is the reward?
I ain't do it for myself, you know who I did it for nigga?

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged
If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged
My future's so bright, that all I see is stars
My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads

I'm criminal minded, winter coat climate
Cold. Fucking up your sinus, bitches might
Choke, I'm giving them the heimlich, I'm a
Pimp in my own fucking rhyming, you my side bitch
UGH...Two chainz, two pinky rings
I like to play with Lucille's: B.B. King
You don't fuck with us, we don't really fuck with y'all
Stunna bought some Yatchs, We in the ocean playing bumper cars
Pocket full of money, bitch, and my crew eating
Got a nigga shining like a brand new nickel
Plated pistol, this's my last shot
Just left the dealership and I cashed out
[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Ace Hood]

Black shades, gold chain, and a Versace scarf
Swear you haters couldn't see me if I glowed in the dark

Still shining a nigga, two chains looking like it's lightning doe
No love for you bustas, keep on steady stuntin'
Mo' bottles of Rosé, yeah you know who run it
Thousand dollar shades on, all gold frames
Mister Fuck-your-bitch-and-leave-her, that's my code name
I'm blowing money in this bitch, I think I'm Birdman
Trapping ain't dead, getting money like the bird man
B-b-b-bad bitches, whole lotta ass
Make you famous in this bitch soon as the camera flash

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Birdman]
If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged

My future's so bright, that all I see is stars
My shades on in the club, I don't (Yeah) see you broads
[Verse 3: Birdman]
In the kitchen and we cooking up that raw hog
Dry when shining, I'm a movie star
Open up the bank bitch, bring em large
Flip em and we bust em, then we ship em off
Perpetrating'll get your head bust
A hundred million, 'll get you dope flush
A new Bentley, you get a ho rush
Big money shit, we popping cause we came up
Hella choppers, on them new thangs
Big yachts, brand new wings
Them hoes yapping, cause they know the frame
Cardinal, Ten Carats on my pinky ring

Dont Pay 4 It,rap,dj khaled,2012,22576,"[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

[Verse 1: Wale]
Pay for that, not me, no hell
Y'all the one that bring the c-notes out
This is K.O.D., now they wait on me
Cause if I do not arrive, there wouldn't be no show
Wale, Wale
Hear you talking, but I cannot stay
Chicks involved, but I cannot stay
I spit the raw, I leave a gay bitch, late
Turn your date to a lake, turn your 8 to a great
Turn a nine to a damn! without paying for the date
No debate, ain't no John
You done broke the safe just to get those broads
You been playing the Uno but you getting no drawers
And I poke her face and let her hold no cards
I ain't even tripping, or paying these women
Got plenty fish in that ocean and my rod game is so vicious
And my sharp show is at 4:50, can I use the rip in 5: 15
Now I 62 cause I get the loot, and she's gon' kiss the ring but no wedding

Clap that ass, bitch, turn up
Nigga kill the pussy, call it murder
Swerve in the Murcielago
Me without a foreign car, man that's unheard of
In the Maybach, king with my feet up
Curtains drawn, bitch scream when you see us
Hi, I'm your leader, word to Onika
2500 for the sneakers, dope ass nigga, no beeper
I was 16 with a Beamer
Glock with the watch on Aquafina
Niggas going, hyena
Getting pussy posted up at the Dinah
Now we pull up, post in Medinas
With light-skinned bitch like Gina
Aston, Martin
Man that motherfucker cold like Keyshia
Stop signs, Simon says
We don't give a fuck, we run them
Like Tommy Young, been barely men
Man broke niggas, we don't live with them
I don't fuck around, I just fuck her friends
Got eagle doors on that brand new Benz
And a threesome with two twenty twins
I'm rich, bitch

Bitch I'm Mack Ma-i-i-i-ine
Trick what? Lace who?
Baby girl, that ain't what Maine do
Before I chase you, I replace you
Before I break you off, I'mma break you
Matter of fact, fuck you
Got a hundred chicks on my tour bus
Asian chicks, they adore us
I'm feeling like the nigga on the chorus
(Got this drank in my cup
And I'm 'bout to roll up)
Man this bitch talking too much, dawg
(I done came down, hold up)
Heard a nigga say pimping was dead
I showed them my watch and corrected them quick like, ""Nah, niggas you're scared""
Now go get you some bread
See it's...
(Money over bitches, and bread over bed)
Tell a bitch that I know Khaled, and she take it to the head
Shit
Shit, one go to store for me
Got another one that's trying to ho for me
Hopefully, she bring more hoes to me
And reverse the game and make em bring dough to me

And let them know they have a choice
Everyone has a choice

[Verse: DJ Khaled]
Heard them people seeking problems with the Godfather
Shockers keep them llama get your head trauma
Pussy boys rather see me dead, mama
Instead I'm in that Maybach texting William Roberts
Riding through the city with my hammer close
Pray to Allah that this trick does not have bash results
Self made all it took was faith and lots of hope
Understand this the realest shit I ever wrote
Arab from the middle east Jerusalem
Duplicate me will never be I'm hot as Lucifer
Palestine mastermind, rowie face, bezels shine
Smoking good, counting paper, tryin' to dodge the Babylon
Yeah, I'm well respected and that's on any block
Talk about the gutter you just pray to make it out
Puffing ganja with them wassels with them dreadlocks
Cracking lots with them mobsters get your dog shot
Motherfucking mogul, foreign without an owner
Motherfucking neighbours bought the whole corner
Bought the whole block,stuntin' on you fuck boys
We the best of all, gotta get that young boy
Gotta let me get 'em
Nah Ace, they don't want war
Just let me get 'em
Nah Ace, they don't want war
I got 'em, I got 'em
Nah Ace, they don't want war
Cause that's that shit we came for
(Khaled)
Steamed fish was amazing, matter of fact
Let me get some jerk chicken to go
Grabbed me one of them lemon pie theories
And let me get some of them cash you theories too
And give me another champaingne cola
But let me ask you a question
What happened to them people asking about me
You supposed to bring them to me

(Waitress)
Dey no sai mistar Khaled
Dey say me one thang one dat you
It let those take their next chance
And dem boi just

Ok now clique full of niggas with tempers
Clique full of niggas and killas

And I drive still walk with the Glock on

Chopper in the trunk in case your mood swing
Extended clips that’s standing tall; two chain

Problem,rap,dj khaled,2006,3921,"[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Yea, when I cop it's 4 doors I'm too big for a coup nigga
An when I go to war I don't get shot I just shoot niggas
An I don't trust a nigga as far as I can throw 'em
Even though I'm feeling strong enough I probably can roof niggas
Yea, your boy back in the booth nigga
I'm off the weed but I'm back on my juice nigga
I beat the case so its off with the suits
Back to Fatigues, black tee’s and Timbaland boots nigga
The year is new, I want my spot back take two
Matter fact take the whole click who you know can fly by in the 05-06
When they see that new V the dope boys go crazy
You know I still fuck with State P still fuck wit Dame Dash still fuck wit Jay-Z
Still real steel still recognize real I still feel it in the air
We kill at will here

[Hook: Beanie Sigel]
First Pac got got, Then B.I.G. clock stopped
Now somethin' going on with the Roc
I'm hearin shit about a break up, the shit people make up
I'm like ""Damn when will it stop?""
Jay and Dame ain't speakin, Game and 50 Cent beefing and Cease got Lil Kim knocked?
I'm hearin all this in the jail while I'm sittin in my cell
An I'm waitin on some mail from the Prop
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo you gotta hole in you and you bleeding
So its not like I'm just callin you ""Pussy"" for no reason
Me? I'm a bastard I hit the blunts till I gotta cough then I pass em
Exhaust on the Aston, that next choice you make might be your last one
Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom
Real talk now, who's the King of New York now?
Boys got safe in the house, I gotta vault now
From my old grams still, with my old fam still
Still gettin wireless head that's with no hands
Listen my grandma in compensation compares to yall's is way beyond exist-ions
D-Block daddy new black Caddy comin through knockin Micheal McDonald and Patty
P's of haze is still going for 8 in the Nati
Rather have God arrest me then Satan to bag me
I'll gladly involve ya moms, Al-Quada Jada I'm only involved with bombs
Put my life on it
Soon as you put in the hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it
I been givin to niggas for years I'm responsible for niggas careers muthafucka!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Hold ya head up Cass don't stress wait a come on fast
Keep to yaself just try not ta come off ass
Cause these niggas ain't playin fair
You know stay on ya square, handle ya biz be the man you say you is
I always been that nigga I said I was
You get booked don't budge look at the judge
An stand up an man up an never play those games
Real niggas don't say no names

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Hanh, holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me, baby)
I'ma pimp her, I'll show her how I live
Take her back, then I put it in her ribs (Holla at me, baby)
I'm a monster, I do it real big
You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me, baby)
You can see it from afar, I'm the shit
Scream at me, what it do, what it is (What it do)

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
It's— Paul Wall, baby, Swishahouse club rocker
Chunk a deuce, sip a deuce, pouring up the Goose vodka
Lone Star beast, straight up out the H
Sure stopping all the hate, sippin on the ski taste
I got the INS on my tail, Immigration still harass
'Cause they see me in a foreign, riding on imported glass
Getting cash is my number-one task
Until I'm under the grass, that's why I'm top of the class
I'm a GRiT Boy looking for a ass like Ki Toy
Leave a bitch back all nutty like Almond Joy
My boy Joey I.E. got the sweet
And Neek got the Sweets, and Gu got the freaks
Beat it up like a ass-whipping
The album dropped, and it's been a lot of ass-kissing
But I ain't tripping, I'm trill
That's why I'm posted with Khaled, 'cause he the real
One hundred, baby, like a bill—holla at me, baby
[Chorus: Paul Wall, Fat Joe, & Both]
Holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me, baby, Khaled!)

Scream at me, what it do, what it is (What it do, ugh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Nah, homie, you done got it fucked up
You ain't got as much money as us (Nope, nope)
We sent Campbell in 'cause he got goggles on
And he pushing something foreign as fuck (Oww!)
Now, all I gotta do is push a little button quick fast
And the chopper come out of the stash (Br-r-rat!)
Yeah, money ain't jewels, motherfucker, you lose
I'll make you do the fucking Sean Combs dance (Follow me now)
Who wan' come test the king?
Have your baby ma' bless the team (Mmm-mwah!)
Shit, I ain't even know she could twerk it like that
She a motherfucking sex machine—holla at me, baby (Oww!)

It's Mr. 305, AKA—
Mr. Snort Yay', Spit Rocks, Made in Dade
I owe my future: the last name Campbell, first name Luther

The bottom, the crib, what they do (What it is)
Bust a clip (Flip a brick)—""Hey, buddy, where's the lick?""
""That's all we talk about?"" Well, welcome to the South
We in, get our bread, then we out, no doubt, huh

Final Warning,rap,dj khaled,2008,1617,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
It's so incredible
Yeah it's the DJ Khaled Khaled Khaled
I do this for the projects!
I got the mothafuckin gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one!

[Chorus: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you know
Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So you betta mind where you walking
God damn man can to your target
Nothin can save you know

[Verse 1: Bun B]
See you dun push the wrong button
And Cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka it was mine
Time and time they get me out the tandem
Me are da true
I traded mine in
For caveman king
You don't wanna fuck with the Southside Gotcha boys
Ya'll ain't know trill ass niggas
Ya'll some boxy boys
And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach
[Verse 2: Blood Raw]
I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet
I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks
I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the Street life
Homie I live
Wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top
East to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled
Nigga we the Best

[Chorus: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you know

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Khaled go let me see em
Hand me the fucking clever
Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the Evel Knievel people
Who try to stunt
Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon shoot a hundred rounds
Bdddddddddddddah
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town
[Verse 4: Brisco]
I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old chevy and figuro
Blood shed apart my feet
And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye
Ring the Alarm
Tell em people come come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun YEAH!
It's the Final Warning!

[Verse 5: Bali]
Khaled these niggas talkin
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one
Ain't golfin'
I'mma put his whole unit in a coffin
Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'mma open his ass off
Like suicide doors
Any badass niggas
Y'all scared of that lake
I'mma tell you once don't be scared of the dre
[Chorus: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who your callin
Nothing can save you know

Tell em go hammer that
And it ain't gon take all day
We know where you live at
I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep em mad shawty

You know I rep my city, my-my-my city
Mr. 305 or better said Mr. Worldwide
Hey Khaled this is for the chicos

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
This for those that chose to sleep on Pits
Not knowing I had a plan for every letter in the Alphabitch
My life's been diarrhea boy I've been through some shit
Turned it all around and now my bank account likes ""Oh shit""
Could have took the coke route, heroin boy dope route
Chevys get dressed up, choppa's get chocked out
AK Quatro Siete Dale Mete Machete
Perico's been a part of my life since I was chupando tete (Woo)
I went from buildings with dope holes and boys with gold fronts
To fucking dope hoes and houses with beach fronts
I hit a lick yeah motherfucker my life changed
But chico won't change, I'm forever Dade (305)
Invest in my future so I'm forever paid
I don't play games fuck boy I ain't EA
Go ahead and hate me til I'm dead in the ground
I'm D-A-D-E, Dade county
Woo
[Chorus: Jarvis]
I'm all in and I rep my city 'til I die
As long as I'm thinking and breathing I'm gon' ride
From the East to the West side
Kept it 100, so I'm good for life
Give a damn what a hater gotta say
Make it this far I'mma do it my way

Give a damn what a hater gotta say
I rep my city, I rep my city, I rep my city, I rep my city
I rep my city, I rep my city, I rep my city, I rep my city

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Miami's red cross when they need me I'm there
I'm from the era when there was gang wars at the Youth Fair
I'm ten years ahead of the game, I know it ain't fair
Used to go to Santa's Enchanted just to pull on Santa's beard
Sat on Santa's lap and showed him some crack
And told him for Christmas all I want is coke that comes back
Something about a 75k a show
Next year it will be 300 per show yeah for sure
Pits always had it on lock
I'm from the bottom bitch ya'll can keep a fucking top
My dog damn it bout to jump out [?]
Look at the way that Chico been running the crib
From rocking stages with uncle Al Virginia key
To rocking sold out crowds at MSG
And I ain't from New York I'm a Dade county representer
That right for sure let's ride
[Chorus: Jarvis]
I'm all in and I rep my city 'til I die
As long as I'm thinking and breathing I'm gon' ride
From the East to the West side
Kept it 100, so I'm good for life
Give a damn what a hater gotta say
Make it this far I'mma do it my way
I'mma do it my way, do it my way
Give a damn what a hater gotta say

I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm 'on one)
I get 'em up! (I said I’m on one)

[Verse 1: Wale]
Ambition
Two white cups and I got that drank
Two dyke jawns but tonight they straight
Redbox flow and I do not date
Real G shit I don't use no cape
I get my cake; I love hip hop
J Cole, Don Trip, Drake, Big Sean
Nigga wanna act we can get improved, bread on me that's a garlic knot
Tats out and my hair long, loud shit, Weird noise
Like B.o.B., Got airplanes, not one J, got a pair or more
Folarin bitch realest nigga in this ho
Shoutout to them niggas who still fuck with me at Interscope
My ambition to blow
This is why I'm in this fo
Women at my pole
This is oh so much like getting votes
I make her kitten moist, this is why her nigga mad
I just give her bigger O's, he just get her bigger bags
I'm an asshole, so what my bitches like it?
I'm why she get excited
You why she buy devices
Tightest writer to write it, dopest flower to quote it
I'm zonin; I'm out Seattle with Little Cheyenne and Tony
What up?
[Chorus: Drake]
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said, fuck it, I’m on one

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
(Kirko Bangz)
Uh, I'm feeling so throwed
I done had this drink since I was 15
And now I'm finally getting on
Told you bout this shit when I was 18
And fuck it, I'm the new nigga
Don't give a fuck bout how these niggas rate me
Ya girlfriend wanna cruise with us
But I'mma need a badder bitch to date me
Uh, I got this money in my pocket
I won't throw it 'less she dropping
Know what? Fuck it, bitch go shopping
See I always keep it cocky
Cause these niggas wanna doubt me
Talking numbers like a auction, fuck yo Porsche and yo bugatti
That you always talk about, but I dont never see you driving
Cause you know that nigga's hungry, and you looking at a lion
I'm the fucking last king, eating dinner with the mayans
Yeah you riding for yo city, but I'm driving
BITCH!
[Verse 3: French Montana]
Sliding with some hoes, as long as that she's 18
Tryna play it safe, tryna stay up out the state green
Big chain drippin down
Everyday same shit, but when I look back, shit different now
Ridin with the same niggas til the death of moi
Coke boy, Montana, you niggas know the repertoire
Uhhn, That street shit, we live boy
That, that, that, you might, not be here next year boy (ARRGHH!)
Got that drink, might be brown, might be white
Move that brown, move that white
My bitches brown, couple white
Cheese steak, Philly boy, Night life, City boy
Fuck a deal, Indy boy, Two chains, Tity Boi
Like, like, like, whats up with your best friend?
Drinkin Henny straight cause a liver cost ten grand
Houses on my left hand

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya

Cause I’m on one, I said, fuck it, I’m on one
[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
I don’t know what these haters be talking, I pop any chick that I want
Put your girl in the back of that ‘Bach, main two reasons she ain’t gone front
I minaj with her and her friend, put my main homie on one
But my neck and wrist so stupid, and my pockets be on so dumb
Because I’m on one
Haters we never condone em
Penthouse full of some bad bitches, me and my homies gon show em something
It’s MMG
Ridin round in this Lambo, goin ham dog on Collins
And I’m leaning off of that purple shit, so don’t judge me like your honor
I’m feeling so cold
Yeah we riding dirty but the whip clean
But think a couple years ago
I was in a cell when I was 18
And whats up with these new bitches, and why they all wanna fuck so easy
And whats up with these new niggas, and why they all wanna talk so greasy

[Verse 5: Tyga]
All these niggas stealing swag
I've been getting tats since I was fourteen
Tell my bitch throw it in the bag
Twenty-two for the Balmain jeans
I'm smoking these niggas they needing nicotine
Rat race, first place famous like a Kennedy
All my diamonds lemonade
Hearts stay below degrees
Too many bitches marry them all, #polygamy
Make a waterfall, Yosemite
Highest underrated nigga, I don't need you rating me
Sold out shows way before this shit was BET
Knocking at my front door, bitches trying to peek and see
Last Kings, YMCMB you know the team
Just counted fifty thou in my Waldorf suite
Man, this life's too fucking easy
Ferrari red all over, call it Santa bleeding

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young

I Wanna Be With You,rap,dj khaled,2013,604920,"[Intro: Future]
It ain't nothin' for me to ball on you
It ain't nothin' for me to spoil you
If I adore you, I'ma give you that theory
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I wanna be where the commas will be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
'Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then it's dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
'Cause it's levels to this shit, and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, baby

[Chorus: Future]
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Make that bad bitch my shorty, hit the club, throw forty
My hat bent like 'Uhh!', my chain drip like water
Car paint like tar, I'ma sex her harder
Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it
Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years
Checked it, look her, you ain't even know, big deal
On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light
That ho chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine
White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain
Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur
[Chorus: Future]
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

Woo! I've been waiting for a long time (How long?)
Real damn long time (How long?)
I've been waiting for a long time (How ya feel?)

I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, B-Biggie
Y'all know y'all done fucked up now, Rozay!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross & Diddy]
Sucka walk up on me, talking like he know me (Come on)
Ain't no codefendant do my dirt all by my lonely
Down south nigga, talking Jam Pony
Rest in Peace to Uncle Al, he showed me my first Rollie
Bitches want to know me, haters want to show me
But I'm just so vicious, double M worth eighty tickets
Cop just pulled me over, caught up in this thing (Woo)
Take my case to trial, my juror Paula Deen
I know they hate a nigga but he's such a major nigga
Give Chelsea Clinton the .44 when C.I.A. was with us
305 the realest, Ricky Ross the richest (That's right)
Belaire on my table, I talk it then I live it

All you starve and I eat fast, Mulsanne when I creep past
Blacked out, I max out with the same watch on Meech hand
We killing niggas, no repents, my momma got like three Jags
You talkin' 'bout you a baller, nigga
We really gettin' that street cash
Say old money, new work, smell the 'caine on my new shirt
My OG said, ""Strap up and don't lay your head where you do dirt""
And my momma said, ""Do schoolwork""
I was making that tool work
And niggas wanted me dead with a whole all in my head
Man they hit Big in the passenger, hit Pac in the passenger
So I'm riding 'round with this Mac on me
And a bunch of shooters in back of us
Roll up, you a dead man, headshots when we clap at ya
We sendin' niggas to the motherland
And I ain't talkin' 'bout Africa

I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me

That gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta shit
I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, B-Biggie

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Feel like it's me against the world, bury me a G
My middle finger to the world, I'm gon' forever be a G
Pussy nigga want a witness, stay armed, no biggie
When we get busy, no alarms, just semis
We pour out a little liquor, thug life, straight balling
We cradle to the grave, ride when my homie call
Give a damn if it mean life or death, what's beef?
When somebody gotta die, we gon' march to the street
They said Brenda had a baby but she left it in the alley
One shot that playa hater now we going back to Cali
Hypnotize niggas, I got a story to tell
My ambitions as a rider got me ready to die
And when we ride on, no more pain, we go hard as shit
Why you complaining? And you wonder why we call you bitch
It's an everyday struggle nigga, me and my bitch
It's unbelievable suicidal thoughts you would get
Said fuck me warning and the gun don't blast
Give me the loot, sorry nigga, give me one more chance
You know this shit don't stop, keep these suckers under pressure
Hollerin' only God can judge me shawty, I ain't mad at ya
Got my mind made up, you nigga ""can't see me""
A paid thug nigga, that's why shorty wanna be me
See a kid around around in your town kick in your door
I feel like Pac and Biggie, love the dough more than you know
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Diddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie (Yeah)
I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me (Come on)
I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind
You know I go hard when it comes to mine

Do it, do it, I'ma fuckin' do it

Maybach Music
Out in Vegas like Lamar, third floor Tropicana
Fascinated with the cars, smokin' dope in the Phantom
Teflon's on the rise, I despise propaganda
Camouflage Mac-11, I should set an example
Never baptized, as I walk through the fires
The pain and the flame never match my desires
Crucified cause I'm rich, in the coupe, take a pic
On the phone at the light, Kelly Rowland's a friend
Catfish in the Benz, Manti Teo's a sucker
Plaques on the wall, hustler so I can say ""fuck 'em""
Bel Air for the hoes, Ciroc in the pool
My bitch is a stripper, her name is April's A Fool

I turn coke boy to that corporate money
Big choppa, I'm walkin' funny

If it was a slumber party, I'd be fresh in pajamas
Silence the shawty, I'm killin' them softly
They slept on me, I stopped sellin' work and started sellin' them coffee

I stay jumpin' out that thing ho, I swear that's word to my momma
I took risks with that 'caine, ho and I sold work for my momma
These niggas don't want no drama
These niggas don't want no problems
These niggas don't want no beef
Have 'em walkin' out with that choppa
These North niggas don't play that
They murk somethin', I'll tell you that
200 change for this Mulsanne and the wheel's a fortune, Pat Sajak
We catch cases, don't say jack
Don't talk work cause they tape that
Don't sell the work where we lay at
And don't spend the bread you can't make back, no

[Verse 5: Ace Hood]
Rest in peace
I'ma start murderin' and bodyin' beats
Ain't no defeatin' the eye of the beast
And I'm laughin' at people who try to compete
Name any rapper that's fuckin' with me
I'm who these niggas pretendin' to be
Claimin' you wantin' these problems
Tell momma get flowers and plannin' your funeral speech
My sanctuary's that cemetery
My choppa, named it ""Obituary""
Act up, Tyler Perry
Boy you sweeter than February
Real nigga, I define that
You don't even need no dictionary
You ain't even 'bout that life
So these shooters with me ain't necessary

[Chorus: Big Sean]
You don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems

Niggas be women like hoes be women
Look at me close, there's no sympathy
Those with envy be throwin' subliminal quotes
I'd rather them warrin' with me, uh
They phony I hate them (Word)
Like Tony Montana, except, no Manolo
She left me for another cuelo (Word)
These dudes is snakes, these women is vultures
Who am I to trust? Who gon' ride for me?
Who gon' light somebody's body up?
When I be like, ""Yup,"" they squeeze
Comfortably (Oh) and that new custom piece
My Tisci t-shirt a couple of G's (Oh)
I talked to a bunch of G's just like a Frozen Tundra speech
And the Lambo' feel
When a real nigga doin' 110 tryna skrrt in it
Yeah, and the world so ill
When the boy get funny over money or a girl on ya
Uh, let it marinate, uh, Wal', let me curate
Uh, let them niggas hate
But never ever let a women tell a nigga, ""Wait""'
Uh, sway

Bitch, I'm on them trees like Tarzan (Trees like Tarzan)
Aw man (Aw man), I want all my cheese like Robin (Robin)
Shrimp or calamari, I'm a young nigga with options (Young nigga with options)
Mm, and you close but y'all ain't close enough
In the VIP, call me the poster child for postin' up
Top floor suite we goin' up
D.A.F. I'm dope as fuck

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm a lover not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is four stories, I tell'em I don't write em'
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor
I say ""187"", make your bitch run my errands
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands it got all under my nails
In a room full of stairs (stares), give em something to see
I be so fucking faded, Who washed the colors with bleach?
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth
I been had the green light, so don't jump in the street
The World's under my feet, I'm just kissing the sky
Tune, what is that smell? That's the shit on my mind, hah
[Chorus: DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you hoes
Fuck all you hoes

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, breaking up the kush, sticky fingers-onics
I'm throwing up gang signs you can see I'm in my vomit
And I'm cool right na' but please dont change the climate
Cause I'm sleeping with the enemy in bulletproof pajamas
I got issues bigger than you, bitches taller than me
Ratchet and Bougie, I like R'n'B
Unapologetic I'm sorry for not being sorry
You niggas old news prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finga
Bad bitches for my home boys
The grass is greener on the other side
I'm focused on my own yard
Ain't got enough, need more dough
We twisting blunts like torsos
I'm rich as fuck but more so, a poor soul
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man
My bitch a die for me, she a soldier, GI Joe-Ann
— take chances when I know I ain't got no chance, roll em
I left that crab table with a chip on my shoulder, huh?
[Chorus: DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches (Fuck all of them)
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you hoes
Fuck all you hoes

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
We ain't got no motive, we just killin' yall for nothing
And my bitch got cotton mouth, you know them snakes cannot be trusted

Cole World
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, back from the dead like Michael Jackson in red jackets
With naps in my head, who's white or black? It's a rare package
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with them square rappers
My guest room's got plantinum plaques and a air mattress
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you
Watching you, learning you, word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you
Sure the thought didn't occur to you, my next album flop
Then I'm goin pop like Nelly with tops dropped on convertible
Porsches, born sinner, not burning no crosses
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits
I gotta do somethin', fightin' depression, I'm trying my nigga
But everytime I think about it, I'm cryin' my nigga
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back
They love to hear a black nigga count stacks, count stacks
[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Forty thousand in my pocket, you see it
Another twenty on the way, you see it (Ay)
I got a fist full of dollars, you see it (Uh)
Five hundred for the Js, you see it (Ay)
I got money out the ass, you see it
I thought I'd never see the day, you see it (Ay)
They put a price on my head, you see it
But they won't ever have to pay, you see it (Ay yeah)
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed
Cause Heaven seems a million miles away
I dreamed of all the things that I would say
On that day

[Chorus: J. Cole]
But for now I'm cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Tell my story, I'm just hopin' they'll listen
Cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
One day, hey

[Verse 2: Bas]
Yeah, omission's usually, an admission of guilt
Hari-kari yourself, all the way to the hilt
You get nothin', no love, zip, zero and zilch
We don't mention you lames, man I be pleadin' the fifth
There's a Judas in every crew, concealing a kiss
Kiss of death, let's put the rest all to tedious bits
Fuck's sake, you niggas emanate effeminate traits
Bitch nigga, we could never relate
Nah, cause man, you niggas is birds
You learn that at bird school or somethin'?
You eaten that bird food or somethin?
You sick with that bird flu or somethin'?
That's my word, cause every where I turn
When folks I known for years that couldn't pronounce my name
And asking me for pics, there's something 'bout this game
It's somethin' for the bitches
It's somethin' for the bitches
[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Forty thousand in my pocket, you see it
Another twenty on the way, you see it (Ay)
I got a fist full of dollars, you see it (Uh)
Five hundred for the Js, you see it (Ay)
I got money out the ass, you see it
I thought I'd never see the day, you see it (Ay)
They put a price on my head, you see it
But they won't ever have to pay, you see it (Ay yeah)

Never Surrender,rap,dj khaled,2013,185525,"[Intro: DJ Khaled & Anthony Hamilton]
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (Nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Point it at your head, got the bread then you blacked out
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like you seein' a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't tryna stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing round-ups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now I'm stunned thinkin ""Fuck that"" (Fuck that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (Get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz
[Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats, they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him, you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love, the hurt's pure
When you front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
You was right there back-to-back with me my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz 'em in then meet 'em right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead, you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'bout what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzers
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches
[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & Meek Mill]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh (Yeah, for life)
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six Os in the bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up, I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm tryna get full, mask on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft and sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge: Akon & John Legend]
My pain ain't never been told (Ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (This knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (In my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
[Chorus: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around (Nobody's around)
Cold world (Cold world) cold world (Mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones that'll take you down (Always take you down)
Cold world (Cold) a cold, cold world

[Chorus: Akon & Anthony Hamilton]
'Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you)
Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you, which I will never do)
Oh-ohh, oh-whoa
Oh-ohh (oh-ohh) oh-ohh

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton, Akon & John Legend]
See there's a story in my life (Hey, surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Hey, surrender)
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh (Surrender)

They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money

They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes
[Verse 1: Plies]
I'm tryna fuck me thirty hoes by the end of this month
Ain't drive my Rolls Royce no more, I seen a fuck nigga in one
I heard some niggas downtown tried to jail me up
I heard they tell the Feds everyday to pick me up
But I'm like damn my nigga what I did to you?
And I'm like damn my nigga what you want me to do?
Want me to burn your pussy ass out and knock you off?
Want me to go by your baby momma house and kick in her door?
Guess what? Some 36 niggas, they’ll be here tomorrow
Don’t know what the fuck they goin' on
I’m gonna go buy some Lamar
My homie pulled me to the side and told me tell me the truth
She say she heard I’m fuckin' her sister I say she’ll fuck me and you

[Chorus: Future]

Say, when you getting money, that shit bring plenty haters
Just cop that Phantom coupe, I list a Grammy later
White crib a couple acres, she fin that good Jamaica
They tryin to count me out
But bitch I’m back like Schwarzenegger
They tryina blackball me, don’t wanna see me win
Hit after fuckin' hit, like there he go again
They say I’m underrated, I’m just misunderstood
They can’t compare to me, I wish, I wish you would
I’m screaming, ""Fuck the world and everything in it""
My homie beat his case, cause they can’t find a witness
You wanna test my G, man fuck this industry
I strap C-4 to your mattress, for those who sleepin' on me
[Chorus: Future]

Murcielago Doors Go Up,rap,dj khaled,2013,28168,"[Intro: Meek Mill]
Birdman, what up?
Last time I seen bird, he said young nigga get this money
Fuck these niggas
And you know what I said
I said, fuck ‘em!
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Uh, murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Born sinner nigga, I was born winnin'
Heart cold, but my soul warm in it
Glock 40 and, I go to war with it
Steady aim, shoota' with a form, with it
And I go on tour with it
If I see it, then you know I'm gon get it
Yeah nigga, for the love of that paper
I got hoes sipping, liquor, six in the morning with it
I’d die for this cream, die for my dreams
As I stay and I fight on the side of the ring
With my back to the rope
Hear the crowd as they scream
But I come out on top like Mohamed Ali, woooo!
These hoes fuck so good
Now lil' nigga get money now
Same bitches laughing at me I was dead broke
Gettin' head from 'em thinkin' how funny now
Brand new Rolls Royce in the summer now
Big boy mink coats when they come around
And they wanna put a hole in my soul
Head shot for a hater now simmer down
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah
Eight million dollars on a brand new Lamb
Suicide like revolvers don’t jam
Mountain top, nigga, high in this fame
Filthy rich, still doing my thing
Popped off, we had to pop that spot
Jewels flying, nigga, we so hot
Yachts, condos, living that life
I’ll do it again and I’ll pay that twice!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down

Got too many racks on me

Chea, look
[Verse: Ace Hood]
Fuck this money nigga, fuck this chain
Fuck my watch, you can have that ring
Keep my whips, you can have that fame
So stressed out, I'm going insane
Young nigga can't even sleep at night
All this money I done seen in life
More cash bring more haters
Fuck around and went and bought a chopper twice
Cause I'm paranoid, and I bury boy
If he playin' with mine, then it's oh lord (oh lord)
Please don't make a nigga do that (nah)
Please don't make a nigga do that
You don't know what the fuck I been through
Plus my lawyer texting me too
Boy my baby momma be trippin'
Talking 'bout child support, I can't do it
I don't trust nobody but God
All these foreign's parked in my yard
Swear last night I swimmed in that money
Then woke up in a million dollar car
Boy I'm too stressed, so blessed
Please somebody pray for me (woo)
I'm suffering from success, Lord have mercy

[Chorus: Future & DJ Khaled]
Got too many racks on me
I can't even go to sleep

Nigga fuck this car, fuck these hoes
Fuck these millions, fuck your feelings

Fuck this house, fuck this condo
Fuck these models, fuck these bottles

Miami! Dade County! Let's ride!

[Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
I’m from Miami, bitch, yeah, that’s Miami streets
And all the haters want to push us, try to give us heat
Baby, we live in heat, so drop that shit and drop the beat
Let's party in my streets and leave the hotel room with dirty sheets
I’m no holds barred, baby, I’m gung ho
They sayin’, “Girl, you ain’t Jamaican, accent's got to go”
And I say, “Hell no, hell no”
I got Jamaica in my lungs, it’s that good hydro
I got that Barbee flow, I’m feelin’ irie
Party, work and chill on the beach all day
Got Corona in my hands, got that iron in my blood
Got my toes in the sand and my God is the Sun

[Chorus: Kat Dahlia]
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck

We in that heat wave, where people ain’t phased
Workin’ to get paid, this town, they don’t play
The girlies like, “Yay”, they like the heart race
White girl on a white girl’s face, and oh-oh-oh
We do it for the thrills, thrills, thrills
We got enough bills, bills, bills
So keep poppin’ them pills, pills, pills
I’m chillin’ in my booth, feet up, V.I.P
Bring my girls to the damn party
Bro, don’t touch me, I got my own money
If you want a drink for free, show my girls your body

Give me a steak, if it’s bloody, that’s fine
Got a roach in my pocket, took Mary J to dine

Ohhhh, New York!
Let's go Listennn!

[Chorus 1: Ja Rule, DJ Khaled, & Jadakiss]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!
(A-HAAAAAA!)

New York is back!

New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side)
(Uh, yeah, uh yeah)
(Put 'em up high, lets ride cause)
(A-HAAAAAA!)
New York is back!
[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo, the hammer and the muzzle came together
All I did was hold on to the pieces 'til the puzzle came together
Before it all got hype
I was in the core of the Apple before it got ripe
So I ain't gotta act like
I'm on top of, or in front of them
If I'm not the best, dog, then I'm one of them
Listen, I'm a different kind of boss
I'm cut from a different kind of cloth
These niggas is different kind of soft
Everybody know it all
Nobody followin' protocol
The money's only good 'til you blow it all
Stacking ever since
Guliani knocked John Gotti (what?)
So now he's running for president
It's a shame what the game's became
But the truth is
There's really nobody to blame
But the music
Lets give it a minute
With no wack gimmicks
Just hard beats and rhymes
To blow breath back in it
[Chorus 2: Jadakiss (DJ Khaled)]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Muh'fucka I'm the heart and the soul of this
You claim king, but we in control of this
Name another rapper you see on the streets
Huggin' the block at the height of a beef!
(Coca!)
(Crack crack crack crack crack crack)
Yellow tape and white sheets
Yeah, that's my backdrop whenever I speak
I know a lot of y'all would love to ice me
Make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant
(Owwww!)
Joe's the business, ask about me
In the middle of the desert and they still can't drought me
You know Coka baby he stay on that New York shit
You seen Weezy coming down on that forklift
And money ain't a thing, unless he come up with
Then I'ma have to hit 'em, make a little breads often
[Chorus 3: Fat Joe (DJ Khaled)]

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
New York, New York, nigga, never went nowhere
I just took off a couple of years
But now I'm back on my day-to-day
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day
Who gon' tell New York ""Time's up""? Flavor Flav?
Cause as much as things change it remains the same
And you can give me the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mosque
An inspiration; the inception, the art
Of hip-hop was born
The rap game was formed
From niggas that's dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds
And argue all day about who's a bigger star; Joe, Jada or Ja?
So close but so far
So many with no start
I can't believe 50 Cent and NY fell off
Then LA came back, then South is running shit
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK!

[Chorus 4: Ja Rule (DJ Khaled)]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!

Put 'em up high, dunk ride cause)
New York is back!

People look at you strange, sayin' you changed
Like you worked that hard to stay the same
Like you doin' all this for a reason
And what happens most of the time people change
People change around you because
They startin' treatin' you different because of your success

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We The Best Music
(Zombie on the track)
Another one

[Bridge: French Montana & DJ Khaled]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more
They don't love me no more
They don't love you no more
DJ Khaled!
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shit ain't been the same since I came through in that hot shit
They gon' talk about you 'til you ain't got shit
Still gon' talk about you when you got shit
All eyes on Meek, I'm on my Pac shit
Y'all rap niggas on some pop shit
I've been duckin' paparazzi with a pop bitch
Glock .30 in the cockpit
Sippin' dirty, conversatin' with the pilot
Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been fuckin' up arenas
I'm with double M, the genius
We the motherfuckin' meanest
And the cleanest in a long time
You pussy niggas hatin' on me picked the wrong time
Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
Blood drippin' on me lookin' like a nigga stabbed him
I be on the money, bakin' soda in the cabinet
Pyrex, tryna whip a Rollie, makin' magic
Laughin' at you fuck niggas gettin' madder
If I feel threatened, I'ma go and get a ladder
And climb up your chest, nigga
Motherfuck your vest, nigga
Motherfuck your couch, I'm with Khaled, the best, nigga

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, hey
Jewels gotta cop, coupes gotta drop
Shit startin' to change, so you startin' to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit startin' to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bullet in the head, they wanna see my shirt red
Live by the code, it's the only way to play it
Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated
Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'd take it
Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
God is the greatest as I'm prayin' in the latest (Woo)
X600 as I swerve, Little Haiti (Woo)
Ou paka bat m'wen, sak pase!
I'm bustin' out the sunroof, nigga, ¡andalé!
My money always comin', no, I'm never on pause
They bring it straight to your door if you a mothafuckin' boss
Let's ride

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh) (Maybach Music)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)

Shit startin' to change, so you startin' to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit startin' to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more
[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Hol' up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?
Ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?
Are you sure? A nigga flip this shit like Jarl Borg
A nigga did this shit, this hardcore
If you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, I mean but who knows?
Salute to all the real niggas out there findin' the loopholes
Fuck all these fuck niggas, hate when niggas come up, igh!
Hopped off the plane, hit the helicopter (igh!)
Tell these crabs in the barrel we eatin' hella lobster (igh!)
Got hella options, like a college team
Hit these bootleg niggas with the Heisman
Fuck the NCAA, nigga!
Let a young nigga get paid, nigga!
Niggas talkin' down on the crown
Watch them niggas you 'round got you wound
Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string
Wrong sport, boy, you know you soft as a lacrosse team
RRRAAAAHHH!

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, hey

It started with some packs (Go!)
Then a couple cars (Jim Jones!)
Wake up with my dogs (Go!)
Took over the block (Lets Go!)
And then we
Ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball
(That's all we know how to do... Who invented this thing!)
Now we run the city (M.I yayo what it do!)
Motherfuck the law (Victory)
Push the latest cars (What the numbers lookin' like Khaled!)
Cause we move a lot of raw
And so we
Ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball
(Ay just have me a drop top on deck when I land.... I be back when its warm!)
[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
I started from an ounce (28)
Stretched that to 42 (ehh)
Flipped that to shawty blue
Took it to the sporty coup (Go!)
Now,I can get it for a 23
So short give me 42, and what the fuck ya gonna do (what else)
BALL!
I'm all for it like Brandon Roy
Long story short, lets fast forward to the brand new toys (swish!)
My jewellery loud, motherfuckers can't stand the noise (turn it down)
My chain swing like the hands on Floyd dammit boy! (watch it! watch it!)
Motherfuckers wanna shoot my brains out (word!)
Tell these niggas catch me I'm in the coop with my braids out! (nigga!)
They said the summer with the roof is kinda played out (so what?)
So I told the dealer keep the ceilin' on my way out
BALL!

[Verse 1: Bun B]
When it's Bud B and Khaled
You know that it's a winner
You know I got the yams like a thanksgiving dinner
I'm trappin' on ham like a thanksgiving dinner
And bringin' a drummer like I'm Mr. Thanskgiving nigga
The game it's switched up
In white winter black
So gimme, he already know the hook me up the fact though
Mo money, mo ice
I ain't buyin' no price swear I'm on that one time
They lookin' so nice
These old ladies saying he look like a low life
I'm in the foreign with a foreign makin' your wife
Got me a piece of a pie
Now where's your slice?

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Shawty in lights
Roll another dice
Big money bitch
Cash money life
Flip another chicken
Bought another chicken
Cook another chicken
Fucked her in the kitchen
Pack another meal
Hot up in the feel
Always strapped
Me and Khaled in the hill
Diamond close to ice
Fly poppin' flights
Uptown solider spit the meal on the watch
And as I proceed to make some more G's
Represent my city
Shoe for bee
Uptown G's
YMCMB's

Bringing Real Rap Back,rap,dj khaled,2010,1066,"[Chorus - Rum]
I'm tired of this bullshit
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors
I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers
We tired of that bullshit
Getting over, make it worse for the next
Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah
(We tired of that bullshit)
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back
I'm bringing real rap back
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's
I-I'm bringing real rap back
I'm bringing real rap back
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's

[Verse 1 - Rum]
I'm officially affiliated, ho's love it and niggas hate it
We the best, we the greatest, book a show, signing papers
S-S-S-Signing like old times, don't even need a whip
Homes for the more valuable, my son tell me I'm the shit
Shawty ain't going down, they let dummy pick and choose
Pass to the oh and boo, she down for that switcheroo
Might-might-might-might catch a switch or two
Still the same old red
Chill with them youngins, but got my game from the old heads
Trynna then yall niggas, killed you in college bro
Show's on Myspace, it ain't hard to find it bro
I'm bringing real rap back, for the Chevy's and Cadillac's
Blue red every color and the G's with neeks

[Verse 2 - Rum]
Look, I ain't hatin', I keep it real, I see what they don't see
Radio ain't the same, they play what they wanna play
All 'bout a budget now, fake is the new real
Lie about who you kill, and get you a record deal
Them folks take a chance with it, give ya advance with it
Promote you like hell man, let you make a lil' dance with it
You good for about a year, then you strugglin' to stay alive
The whole world forgot about ya, back to 9-to-5
Put it down all the time, put on my real jeans
Got 'em big, 45, can't wear no lil' skinny jeans
No women tendencies, plus I can really spit
These niggas is really bitches, go 'head, tuck your dick
[Chorus - Rum]
I'm tired of this bullshit
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors

I-I-I'm bring real rap back
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's

[Verse 3 - Rum]
I'm offended by all means, everybody rap now
I can't even blame 'em though, the drug game locked down
Determined to be the next, care less 'bout a record sale
Will dummies succeed or fail? Shit, only time'll tell
Glad to be out the sale, glad to be out the hood
Glad I ain't got a lot, I do what you others should
Boy, you're a fucking jerk, loosen up on your shirt
Nigga scramming out this bitch
And you feeling 'bout all this work?
I know nigga's mad at me, expose these clowns though
Niggas just claim shit, don't even know what it stand fo'
You pussies ain't trained to go
Keep bragging 'bout hood dough
Your nuts don't hang low, boy he's a man-ho

Intro,rap,dj khaled,2010,2253,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
In life, there's people that hustle
In life, there's people that grind
And there's We The Best music who make History
History is something that cannot be forgotten
I've been through everyone black, I have seen an overcome in the evilest hate ever that man can as ever wicknesses
They told me ""no"", and I told 'em ""yes""
I have helped so many, and some have fogotten
I have been challenged, and I always win
I have been to wars, and came out with no scares
I have been tested, and I always passed
This sound contains my pain, my blessings, the stars on this album is my voice
The drums on this album is my heart beating
People feel victory is just a win, Victory is a strugglee, a journey of life
Victory is accomplishment, Victory is a survival
When you're on the way to tap, they cheer for you
When you reach the top on the noun, they want you to die
I speak through my music, I'm so hood, we takin' over, I'm out here grindin', I go hard, I am the streets
You can't stop what is destined to win
When they say Khaled, they say Warrior, Loyal, the chosen one
It's always the way that caused you that don't wanna see your grind
I tell 'em watch me now and learn
I stil find a way to forgive

Gangsta Shit,rap,dj khaled,2006,1331,"[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]

Dey beggin for attention I'm beggin for a reason
Masked up get these straps yeh it's unseasoned
These niggas broke they joke

Gangsta shit duffle bag full of bricks
Add it all up save for the chips
Holy Guacomole! datz a whole lot dip

Well bury ya today datz a whole lot of trips
Say he got six chevys now that's a whole lot of whips

Gangsta shit gangsta shit the way I do my thang gansta shit
Gangsta shit I'm just a young ghetto nigga with a big azz chain

You recreate a shield you betta respect us

Two chunked out chains we call dem double deckers
You comin for that saint nigga we bound to wreck ya
My niggas add flavor to the game like zeteran
Bitch my 25th tool I'm a concrete veteran
We eat wheat niggas up like corn on the cob

[Verse 3: Blood Raw]
Errbody claim reson errbody kno the game

But on the real shit

Let's do it, Khaled
Yeah
Styles P
Konvict Music
Hey

[Chorus: Akon & Styles P]
Hustle if you wanna, whatever you feel (Yeah)
Move that marijuana, from fast in the hill (Move it)
Strapped on the corner, loaded with dumdums (Loaded)
Trafficking's normal where I come from
But Five-O steady peepin' around the corner (Hey)
Steady peepin' around the corner (Oh-oh)
Steady peepin' around the corner (Hey)
Steady peepin' around the corner (Let's go Khaled)
Watch out now

[Verse 1: Styles P & Akon]
Most of my money is dirty
Got it from a robbery or flying them birdies
Truck hijackings, big guns up in my jacket
And I don't give a fuck about rappin' (Watch out now)
Listen, [?] peepin' around the corner (They peepin')
Mob boss holdin' meetings inside the sauna
Had my man sweep for the bugs and informants
Turned myself in with a bail, I got a warrant (Watch out now)
Niggas wanna rap about bricks but never put a gram on the strip (Damn)
But SP the Ghost is enormous
If you nice like me, put your bricks up (Put it up)
I'll beat you and turn my Benz truck to a pick-up (Watch out now)
Your homies gon' have to pour liquor
Get their T-shirts made cause the fo' gon' hit ya (Hit ya)
And I ain't really tryna be malice (Uh-uh)
You'll be M.I.A. but not like Khaled
[Chorus: Akon & Fat Joe]

Nigga, Joe ain't talkin'
Hawk hit 'em, leave 'em wit' a limp in his walkin'
Just to make sure, I'll [?] your coffin
Tenth wake this week, just gettin' exhausted (Watch out now)
Yeah, got ya Birdmans, got ya Snowmans
It's Cutco, over a billion sold, man (Crack)
Yeah, I bet the smack make 'em lean now
And I'm a pipe, bet they crack make 'em dream now (Watch out now)
Yeah, nigga, Crack the realest (Uh-huh)
Mossberg flow, so you niggas are fearless
We do it for our muhfuckin' trappas and killas
Niggas gettin' they guap, still clap at the children (Brrat) (Watch out now)
Got the MAC with me (Uh-uh), chopper close by (By)
And we don't ever see y'alls, I guess you're gun-shy
Nigga, you ain't got nothin' for us
And you know it's that real shit, Akon on the chorus (Khaled)

I know you seen the movie, dawg: the world is ours
Set our own salary, see me serving powder
I see sick shit, so I'm kinda sick myself
I go shopping, the sick shit I get for self (Watch out now)
I need a million dollar watch that can call a helicopter
No ice in it, I'm just into helicopters
Hunnid shots, no Glocks were holding on the stock
Back-against-the-wall brawl, balls like 2Pac (Watch out now)
Look me in my eyes, you will see no disguise
What make the dick rise: keys taped to her thighs
To my murder mamis: supreme team, GS's rims on it
Yeah, them things (Watch out now)
Dade County, 305, we all that
I could drop it in the pot and bring it all back
I could whip it, whip it, whip it to get the motherfucka rock
I could whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it in Mac Ross

[Chorus: Lil Scrappy]
You can be as fuckin real as you want
And hard as you will
But you will never be nothin like me
You can rock with the 12's in the trunk
Get so drunk
But you will never be nothin like me
You can go and fuck with a ho
A pocket full of dough
But you will never be nothin like me
Yea yea you wanna act hard
I can tell in your eyes you will never be nothin like me

[Verse 1: Lil Scrappy]
Born, Devil riches son the second
My daddy blessed me with a wonderful weapon
Hoes see me and they keep on stepin
So my momma took me to school taught me pimpin lessons
Oh, I kno you ain't tryin ta call your people
Cause I got people that'll sue your ego
Sum of em in the club with a desert eagle
U ain't gone win a fight unless you got it like we do
Equal, naw nigga we ain't equal
U said you pop cris they wouldn't believe u
Look at the time it's way past your curfew
I'm a back up cause I don't wanna hurt u
Aw man these niggas throwin bottles on the stage
I'm a still go out and rep the A
If you take it outside I'm a get the cake
Aye shorty I said get up out my face
But anyways
Ya'll niggas don't kno me, don't kno my name
Jus kno me by my fortune and fame
They want me to b humble shorty but I can't
Don't get all mushy eyed shorty let me explain
There's alot of mothafuckas out there that hate
I might catch a case cause I gotta gun on my waist
People out seein what kinda moves ya make
Scrapper get the hell away from a nigga that's fake, aye
[Chorus: Lil Scrappy]
You can be as fuckin real as you want
And hard as you will
But you will never be nothin like me
You can rock with the 12's in the trunk
Get so drunk
But you will never be nothin like me
You can go and fuck with a ho
A pocket full of dough
But you will never be nothin like me
Yea yea you wanna act hard
I can tell in your eyes you will never be nothin like me

[Verse 2: Lil Scrappy]
You say you hot but you ain't dat

If I steal your girl shorty jus call me the mack, (scrap)

If they hatin shorty then you need betta delivery
I'm from the A-Town, Southeast, Zone 3
If ya touch me then you get your ass beat
Some of ya'll lames ain't got enough on your track sheet
To clap me you gone need a crowd to see me
Look in the mirror I know you wanna be me
Mad cause your girl on my dick like bologna
Look dude, I don't want you nowhere near me
I'm a real G nigga and that's clearly
If ya come around I'm a knock ya silly
If ya can't hear me then ya got to feel me (Yea)
[Chorus: Lil Scrappy]
You can be as fuckin real as you want
And hard as you will
But you will never be nothin like me
You can rock with the 12's in the trunk
Get so drunk
But you will never be nothin like me
You can go and fuck with a ho
A pocket full of dough
But you will never be nothin like me
Yea yea you wanna act hard
I can tell in your eyes you will never be nothin like me

[Verse 3: Homeboy]
(What my name is?)
H-O-M-E boy
Through a microscope, you niggas can't see me-e boy
If you jump inside my body could'ntbe me-e boy
Bullets bust on sight so freely-e boy
I'm a monster, evil, Chucky me Freddy Krueger
Bitch nigga I will do ya, with 9 millimeter ruger
I'm hell on earth now that's what they told me
Hotter than the flames in hell, so hell could'nt hold me
No man control me
Follow no one, I'm a leader
I'm Homeboy, Bitch I'm off the mothafuckin meter
Right now or tomorrow I'm a see ya when I see ya
Cock back and make me pop the lid off the Pringles
C'mon, once I step outside of my zone
Bullets fly jus like that star wars attack of the clones
Listen up got some shit that'll part your hair round here
We from Georgia, it's the spot
We some bears down here
[Chorus: Lil Scrappy]
You can be as fuckin real as you want
And hard as you will
But you will never be nothin like me

On my way from freeway to the presidential suite
And b you lookin' weak without chrome feet
And if you ain' got candy then yo ride ain' complete

You remember Mr. Wonderful, that's my dad
Kept my toes on marble flo's, swimmin' in cash
My mama name 'Nessa, taught me the game
16 ladies rollin with a fly ass chain
Use to ride through the city, in hollywood benz
God blees the dead, I'ma see you again
I was the baddest at the west, I'll take yo man
I sneak him into Strawberry's after pack jam
Or Miami Nights, at Miami nights
We was up all night, till they cut the street lights
But now I been crowned as the queen
M-I-YAYO home of the triple beam, ya' mean
DJ Khaled put it on
Diamond Princess, a star is born

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire & DJ Khaled]
Yea, Yea, Yea What up Khaled
Ay, I'm pullin' up in somethin' you should take a picture of
Liftin' up the lambo do's, go and give yo chick a hug
Paint wetter than the suds in ya kitchen cuz
Larger than a dove, and it don't feel like O.J. Simpsons glove
Reincarnate Picaso out of the grave
And still couldn't compete with the way my ride is sprayed
Rims stayin' on the run like a runaway slave
The top is chop-chop, like a summer day fade
Vallet be slippin' slidin' when they standin' by this caddy
My paint wet (yup) watch it do the trick daddy
Me and E got fly rides, if you want it then get at me
If it fit then I don't want em they suppose to fit barely
I made straight As in spanish Khaled they must have forgot though
(How many cars Koopa?) Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Add another cuatro, I got another drop so
I'm buildin' a garage on top of the one I got (oh)
Tell the maker of the Chevy that I'm ridin' silly (silly)
Turn it up, heavy bass'll make it pop a wheelie
I know my cheese is at stake but I'm not from Philly
Jackers watchin', plottin', so Chamilly went and cop a milly

Intro We the Best,rap,dj khaled,2007,2325,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Tryin to talk to 'em...
When there's no more music left
And the lights go out, all you hear is silence
I'll be that voice
(Give it to DJ Khaled for doin it
Y'all the big dog, Pitbull, Terror Squadians - YESSS!!)
Dade County, it's our time
The movement's here forever
And I won't stop 'til I see them devils
And I won't stop 'til I defeat the devils (nigga!)
They all told me that I would fail
They all told me that I would lose
But I'm right here, and I won't lose
Can't NOBODY stop me! I'm somebody
My brother Dre told you to BE somebody
Carol City know what I'm talkin about
The movement! (Fuck niggas!)
I introduce you to..

[Verse: Rick Ross]
.. Ross!
We the best of the best, fit of the fittest
Dead man gon' feel us the way I'm feelin this Phillie
No really we the best (we the best) and I'm the boss
Do I still hustle? Yes... I'm Ricky Ross
Started with the dirt now I'm travellin the world
In a new silver spurt buyin pieces of the Earth
Low mileage; don't need some
No smilin; I'm easin!
Rollin on that thang thang, when I lane change
Haters lookin at me crazy, boy I'ma bang bang
M-I-A yo, we the same gang
C.C. to Down South, e'rybody slang 'caine
Don't see another way, if you do show it to me
Got good green? Green-ass nigga, blow it with me
Cop me a drop, paint mine real pretty
100 grand in the Chevy, rep my city
[Outro: DJ Khaled]
I rep my city like a G's supposed ta
I rep my city like a G's supposed ta
I rep my city like a G's supposed ta
I rep my city like a G.. nigga!
Can't nobody stop me, I'm somebody
From this day on you gon' be somebody
We the best, we don't fear nobody

A candy car strutta that be sittin' on butta
Comin' straight up out the gutta with the cordaless cutta
Man, what is that? The Chinese choppa that likens Mr. Studda
What a fucked up predicament (Damn), a scary scenario
Automatics in ya face have you preparin' ya burial (hol up)
They tracin' tha weapon after you scratch off the serial
Leaves you up like cereal, there it is and there we go (there we go)
Some bad Didos ridin' off in tha wind and
Nigga we got all ya soft in ya hands so don't pretend
Like this ain't what it was (was) or we ain't what you say (say)
I'll make a high cappa or court fraud light in tha day (day)
Cause in the middle of the street in height of tha traffic
Watch what you say when we meet cause they know might get yo ass kicked (huh)
End up in a pickle like a Vlasic, UGK nigga
We cost like a foreign but get respect like a classic muthafucka

Choppin up tha slab, spokes turnin, bobbies searchin
Shoppers splergin, caked up cause my pockets swoll
I'm callin plays, pullin broads, I just think and roll
I'm from that lone star, tippin dime dat candy car
Get it shined on 59, lean and tuck I'll cut some more
Hoes wanna who we are, fathers wanna know what we get
Hatas wanna talk down a knot, but they just mad cause they ain't hot
They ain't got the cash that I got, they don't know what my hood 'bout
They don't know about trunks that pop on Lambo's that blaze tha chop
Countin cash and stackin not, South victory back to Scott
Crawlin like big crocodile, I'm diamond smile and Johnny watch
I'm with my partner, box, you and you and not with 'cho

Feel my pain
The internet can't deal with a nigga like me
Cause I keep it so hood, yeah I keep it so street
The industry hate but they gotta see me
Turn your TVs on bet all you see is me
Nah I ain't playing why you trying to blame me
Might as well hate the world instead of hating on me

Mo' money, mo' problems

I bought 'em Bugattis
The beast and I feast, from the bottom
The youngest in charge
Feed 'em heat with the teeth with the lava
Ain't stopping, I'm steady mobbing
Leave you inside of a coffin
Bitch I am Ace, that's the H to the double-O-D
And when you mention greatness, bitch
You better be mentioning me
And when you say the best
You definitely mentioning we
They said I couldn't do it
Proving them ludicrous niggas who doubted the music
They influenced and moved it through me
I'm Times 3, hit a fiend and it's deeper than me
Call me Young HOV they way I change and I bank on the beat
My Album coming tell em pussies they staying asleep
It's G-U-T-T-A, I serve 'em as raw as the beef

Defend Dade,rap,dj khaled,2008,920,"[Intro: Pitbull]
Khaled check this out right
I know we global now, world wide 305
But I see that they are trying to bring down the movement
I'm telling everybody in the crib they can bet on me
One time, Lou Diaz (that's right)

[Bridge 1: Pitbull]
Put your money where your mouth is, bet on me
Put your money where your mouth is, bet on me
Put your money where your mouth is, bet on me
Put your money where your mouth is, bet on me

[Chorus: Casely (Pitbull)]
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY)

You're back won't last with checks you can't cash
[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Keep disrespectin', in the the everglades they'll find ya
I'm not from San Fransisco, but with a chopper I'll forty-ninya
I grew up listenin to Luke, and... and... and pumpin Trick
Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed
I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it
I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies
I seen them trying to bring you down
But fuck that dog you one of the greatest!
Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters
I remember the Temple at Onyx, I was too drunk to get in
I was still outsider selling Chronic you know gettin it in
I remember Ump beating the rape mistrial, celebrating the win
Ya'll can try to stop Miami but this shit will never end

[Chorus: Casely (Pitbull)]
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash
[Verse 2: Pitbull]
One time TS, two times Fat Joe
I remember them boys in Wynwood Hoodstock Show
I remember them Cash Money Boys in Little Haiti
All running with Zoes
Banana Azuri, soft drop top that's fo sho
Flo Rida, Ground hard always show love before
Dammit been paying dues, now it's my time to blow
Even when 50 come through
He don't roll no less than 50 zoes!
Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows
My dog Noseshaker, come through the block on something clean
Sounding like an earthquake, he is what these dope boys dream
Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck
That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up

[Chorus: Casely (Pitbull)]
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like

You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash
[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat
I love it when these boys come from out of town
And think Miamis sweet
All of them down looking for pussy, trying to Miami skeet
That's when they run up in they hotel room
And give them a Miami treat
When the choppers start a raining, it's hard to stop a Miami leak
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach

[Chorus: Casely (Pitbull)]
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY!)

Piss Em Off,rap,dj khaled,2012,467,"[Verse 1]
Fresh on the scene, I just let the swag talk
Watch, I pull up in that foreign just to piss 'em off
Had to whisper to my dog, I say we here to ball
Chain ring, wrist bling, I'ma piss 'em off
Okay, more bottles of Rosay
Hermes on her waist, complimented by that oche
Looking kinda fly Mr. Hood what them hoes say?
Pissing n*ggas off by the bezel on the watch face
On that nick Shorty, this just how the boss play
Phantom with the two tone, left it with the valet
You know how I'm ridin', catch me couping on a Sunday
B*tch I am the sh*t. We clear? Blu-Ray

[Hook]
Check the swag - yea, it's on
Gettin' cash, the bank roll
I get it fast, never slow
Piss 'em off just to let them haters know
Let 'em know you will never meet a n*gga this fly, I ain't lying
Got the top off the wip
You ain't ridin', you ain't ridin'
If the watch under 40
You ain't shinnin', you ain't shinnin'
Piss 'em off, you n*ggas all talk, ain't buying it
[Verse 2]
Old man, ten grand, bought the whole mall
Heard they hatin' so I did it just to piss 'em off
Chilling with a bad b*tch Mrs. WhatchaCall
Put her in a red bottom just to piss 'em off
Good lord, you know what the wrist cost
Bid the pretty penny probably triple what your rent cost
Yea a n*gga shine it, like cutting on a chandelier
Hop in about that Porsche, why of course that be the Panamera
Louis, Gucci, Findi or Versace be my day a apparel
That sh*t that you're talkin', it's nice — Christmas carols
I ain't wit the bullsh*t, i do this for real though
Kick it with a player, talking game when the field goal
Swimming in some money, f*ck around and do a backstroke
You know how I like it baby, you just keep your back low

We da, we da
Da best
Sping of ours

[Verse 1: Vado]
Yo!
Most hated, incorporated with wealth
Underrated, I felt had to operate it with help
Separated myself in these decorated to bail
Got educated and dealt with places safe than the melt
God gift as a kid, blockin up all previous
Like who's not scared of chain too on that park bench
Watch keep shit and shapon sick
You stick to conscience, hit the corner, take over walkmens
Like G money and that Wrangler
Showin this new drug that I had, niggas it's danger
Spittin Basquiat, I'm a painter
Every hard verse, great off work, you can hang up
No need to read the book when the author's here
Everywhere I look feds parkin here
Empty out the clip in yo partner's beard
Why'd he get a shave? Anesthesia and the partners chill
[Chorus: Vado]
Yo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (wussup)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost
Yo, I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (wassup)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost

[Verse 2: Vado]
All my niggas can wait 'cause soon all my niggas be straight
And all my niggas will wait, then what
All my niggas is safe
Banana clips with the K so that all my niggas be safe
The quick to pitch every day, you don't know my niggas be late
Wait, Frank Noola when I'm last tappin' her
Dom's all up in his face like the smack ballad
Was in the lake but move water like the back paddle
They try to name the place so all deserve to mack at you
B4 the C4
Was drug trafficking, travelling, make em detour
Painting preachers, coliseum, listen we need more
Grantin wishes, drippin 6's, preachers off D4
We da best, I don't see the rest
And I'ma be the best so I don't need the rest
Need a short stopper, not without a G to catch
My niggas drove high faster than a G a pack
[Chorus: Vado]
Yo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (wussup)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost
Yo, I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (wassup)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost

I’m turned up 'till my knob broke
You say turn it down I say nah ho
My neck rocky like Balboa

In the St. regis on all floors
I got six sluts on all fours
They french kissin' say bonjour
I got my own shine but I want yours
I’m stupid rich got stupid bitch
Who stupid thick in Louboutin
Don’t like me, fuck you again
Wanna fight me well come do it then
Right hand to God on everything
I see the hearts of men and they very lame
I won’t entertain no punk shit
They talk shit and I run shit
Boy you tryin’ to get what I been here
Hold it down for like 10 years
I’m gettin’ it in til it's unreal
Let’s say one album and like ten mill
Plus my swag is stupid low IQ (dumd)
Hurt nigga feelin’, I don't try to
But when you ballin’ like I do

Neck froze like cold winter
Stand by me in need a chinchilla
Presidential got plenty rocks
Roc boy like I know Jigga
Riding off in that new shit
I told the dealer you can keep the ceiling
Plenty bitches wanna get the business
I told them it's my dick decision
Goons with me, need supervision
Murk ya dog if it's slight tension
I hit once and my mind gone
Tipper's short but my dreads long
See a star come make a wish
Come take a flick with ya camera phone
I'm in the club and I'm turnt to the max
Better be pretty, I'm turning 'em back

They Dont Love You No More  Remix,rap,dj khaled,2014,20557,"[Intro: Remy Ma]
You ain’t got love for me, my nigga?
You ain’t got love for me, my nigga?
(We the best music)
I'm back, yeah
(Remix)
Ever since your chick hit the top
Know your bitch is mad, Remy out the box
(They don’t love you no more)
You don’t love me no more?
She the best
(DJ Khaled)

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
When y’all was on the TV I was with the PV’s
I listened to your CD, damn, you really wanna be me
Don't care if your name buzzin’, you know who the queen be
Dello Russo did you lasik, bitches still can’t see me
These rap chicks try to stay away from me
Maybe ‘cause I caught that case, they afraid of me
Rem got that flow, spit it crazily
And it’s a fact I’m everything they portray to be
Nevermind  how long been down, y’all know how I give it up
Fuckin’ a player in Milwaukee, y'all know I keep it a buck
Probably should have been a nun, y’all know I don’t give a fuck
My lips ain't big for nothing , on the right night might could get it sucked
Give it to her in the tummy, y’all know that I keep it tucked
Claim she fly and got a bill, to me that sound like she a duck
I’mma take these bitches job and get them worked like Loaded Lux
On my Cali swag, black Raiders cap and a pair of Chucks
Bad bitches rolling with me and a couple model mutts
Used to have some flab on ‘em, but they put it in they butts
Yeah they call me Scarface, a bitch still cute as fuck
Some call me dollface, some niggas wanna kiss my crotch
[Hook: French Montana (Remy Ma)]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (yeah)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box
They don't love you no more (y’all don’t love me no more?)
They don't love you no more, yeah
Troops gotta cock (uh huh) coupe's gotta drop (yeah)
Shit starting to change so you starting to change, ah
They don't love you no more (they don’t love me no more?)
They don't love you no more (they don’t love me no more?
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit starting to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love me no more?)
They don't love you no more, nah (they don’t love me no more?)

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Okay, I’ve been gone for over half a decade
Don’t tell me all y’all done fell for these hoes facade
I mean façade, they garbage, discard them
These hoes is pussy, I discharge ‘em
They don’t even get my dick hardened
I heat a bitch up, Miami, Chris Bosh ‘em
Microwave ‘em, see all my fans waving
The flow water juice drippin’, the girl so wavy
They say the girl crazy, really can’t blame ‘em
They blow dick, I blow torch, just flame ‘em
Hoes so lame and ain’t no taming Rem
I flip quick, no gymnasium
You don’t got no balls, just a big cranium
Shoot me down, I won’t fall, iron titanium
I’m telling chicks ain’t no touching me
I’m celibate, nobody can't fuck with me
Some say she nice, but Reminisce nicer
I can feel the tension, please don't hype her
Tell her stay in her lane before I side swipe her
Droppin’ that bird shit ,I'd hate to windshield wiper
Been violating before I land on Rikers
Ain’t shit change like a baby dirty diaper
I don’t love these hoes, never even liked her
Remy Makavelli, send shots through bellies
Come through in a pair of Breds and a peanut butter Pelle
These fucking fruits is sweeter than grape jelly
Softer than R&B, ma’, you aren’t me
You pop like coochie, I really R-A-P
[Outro]

Maybe it's that Virginia in me (Nigga, say something)
Have a young nigga go so hard (And stay stunting)
Oh, but through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like them cowards
When it hit me, get me?
Girl, I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
Started from the bed, ended up on the floor
And I lift that ass up off the ground
I'ma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been serving
Away from the realest nigga in here, I'ma take you away
And I'll hold you down, I'ma hold you down

Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
Even when the roses die, you mesmerized by the flying sky
We gotta socialize and cherish times (Git, git)
This shit is deeper than love
I pull up in that Lamborghini (Woo), the doors in the sky
Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck (Oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'll hold you remix
You are, you are
Be sure you got a rider beside you to hold you down (DJ Khaled!)

[Verse 1: Usher]
I'll hold you down (We the best music), I'm on my way
My mama told me (you are) make sure you got a rider beside you
Even if you ain't have all the money, fame and the power huh
So I found her, fly shit to jump up out her
I pick her low valley, she rock with me, it don't matter

[Chorus: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down
Now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'mma get money, nigga, smell it on my gear
Black bottle, boy, baller hood billionaire (ah)
Boots in the mud, now it's marble floors (what)
Staircases to the roof look like it's heaven's door
Said a prayer for my woes who be dead and gone
How could I let you down if you never hit the phone? (ah)
Then they gave him all his money, make you go insane
We fucked the game, she said she knew that I would never change
Trap star, two bricks in the match box
Gold D's, fat boy, peanut butter top (wah)
I wanna spend a night with Jessica White (right)
But is a dopeboy really Jessica type?
[Hook: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down

I'll hold you remix now (huh)
I'm on my way (we the best at holding it down) to hold you down]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
We the best
Yeah, we the best at holding it down
She said he don't hold her down right
Some day she'll be done with him
I say there's 7 days in the week, some day ain't one of them
You gotta know your worth, baby, don't give 'em no discount
All of mine are dime, you see a nine, it was a miscount
And I'm the one to tell a bitch to bounce
I'm the one who getting this amount
I'm the one with this foreign shit
Name still getting mispronounced
Hold up, who you held down? When you ever put bail down?
I'mma keep picking money up like the motherfucker fell down
It's an us versus y'all thing, we a small gang
Just the two of us, baby, but we all bang
Bang, bang, bang like what set you claim
And when they asked me that, baby, you know I said your name

There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down

Keys to the whip, key to the mansion
I fuck you while counting money, I'm just that romantic
See we be Bonnie and Clyde and I keep that heat like Udonis
And if it ever go down I know you won't snitch to your honor
That's why you draped in designer, Chanel and all kind of shit
She with the realest and all 'em lames are too counterfeit
It's been a long time and she's still holding me down
(This the remix)
Nevermind the hoes I've been fucking with that's out of town (let's ride)
I have been through hell, had ups and downs
But in the long run still here
I apologize for when I be talking that freak shit in the air
She still moaning, I know you want it, I go to switching that gear
On everything, she never changed for real
That's why

I’m on One Single,pop,dj khaled,2015,7385,"[** feat. Drake, Rick Ross & Lil Wayne:]
(Get em on)*
I’m on one
(Get em on)
I’m on one
(Get em on)
I said I’m on one
[Drake:]
I’m getting so throwed
I ain't work this hard since I was 18
Apologise if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!
[Chorus: ~Drake~]
All I care about is money and the city that I’m from
I’ma sip until I feel it, I’ma smoke it till it’s done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one
Yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one
Fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I’m on one
I said fuck it I’m on one
[Rick Ross]
I’m burning purple flowers
It’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (BOSS)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin’ 8′s
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair
[Drake - Chorus]
[Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I’m focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Ohhh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence

Okay, phone off the hook, yeah, that bitch won't stop blinkin'
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring
You've been drinkin' and drinkin', you're drinkin' for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah, leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leavin'
Callin' shots, refereein', no drama
Pussy so wet, I'ma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy, I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodgin' the leeches, I'm signin' agreements
I'm signin' new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimmin' with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixin', this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, ""Bingo!"" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh
Another one

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ricky Ross, a.k.a. Moneybags, feel me?
Put my life on the line, but I'm likely to grind

That's how I get the freaks, strawberry Swisher sweets
You'll be dealin with H, when you dealin with G's
Smash it deal with the realest, shoppin like it's still December
Diplomat on the fender of the Phantom I'm the winner (winner)

You suckers wish you could, Ricky Ross its in the bank
[Verse 2: Jeezy]

Don't care what nobody says I got a hunnid on Kobe

Dark boys on the black Jags
See in them black masks, now they can't stand my black ass

Bodies gon' fall (fall) tell em it's Ace (Ace)
If I catch a charge nigga I'mma flee the state
Hit my niggas L.A. Reid and Khaled watch me beat the case

Breasts Brazilian, she, talk familiar
Her look will hurtcha, her walk will kill ya
Now I'm with Khaled, he got me a mansion
How come every girl up in here look like an actress?
Baby girl, if i find my camera, I'll point that thing directly at ya
My wrist is a bitch and my neck, a bastard

I'm fresh, I'm cool, dapper
All white tennis shoes, look like napkins

But gangsta's don't die, they jus move to Miami
Yea, hop on the bike and peel
Come down Collins on one back wheel
Baby, I'm the hottest, and that's for real
Come to the condo, in ass and heels
Have a drink, have some pills
And make her think I'm Shaq O'Neal
If she won't tell, then I won't squeal
It's the sunshine state, and I'm glad I'm here

Jones!
You understand what's going on right now?
Dipset, Bird Gang, some real Geed up shhit
Listen
305, all the way to the top
Eh Khaled, what's good?

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Rocks like bolder game
Crazy upstate
Test the Rolls in the lane, racing up the A
We betting thousands on street corners
Roll the dice with police on us
Slow like the Henesy
Cold tonight, need the seat warmers
[?] slice [?]
[?]
4 door, welcome [?]
Heavy supercharger
Goods, no war
That's for beginners, I'm living like a winner
[?]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
You don't want a robbery, nobody trying me
Looking for some good in me, lil bit of god in me
Right now, whole lotta shit startin to bother me
Wanna see some vains spilled, shit load of arteries
Any rap motherfucker tryna say they hard as me
Tell the truth, I don't know why these niggas start with me
I been in it now, fuck a semi
Get a rocket launcher, I better shoot your Bentley or your hand me downs
Khaled, you should warn them niggas, ad an extra listen on 'm
Then figure out who make the paper that say ""missing"" for 'm
Layin on the top, bigger than a fishing form
Go and get your whole crew, round up the craziest
Send them here, I'll send them back and show you what the raiser did
We ain't getting paper nigga, you can meet your maker nigga
Turn you purple and yello, just like a laker nigga

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Any cat that rap, step to me, I'd catch a felony
I just beat a murder, what the fuck these niggas telling me?
I'm not into this rap shit, practicing infedelity
These [?]
I could still sell a key
I'm the hustler motherfucker, I could sell a tree
To the forest, the hardest niggas is with me
Mad cause they money is funny like Bill Belomy
And wanna put a shell in me, dog but it's all jealousy
You smellin me, but you refuse to diss me
Cause I keep a tool that could fuckin remove a kidnie
I keep a 9, the same kind Shyne used for Diddy
Plus I keep the chopper, it pop when I crues the city
Just in case a nigga get wreckliss, try to test this
And I gotta knock out his breakfast out his intestines
Said I'm on his death list, I don't care what niggas bout
If I hear a nigga mouth, then Imma air a nigga out
[Verse 4: Rob Cash]
My bro Khaled said ""bring the heat"", birds think I got it, sweet
Cause I rode with Pistol Pete, my shit complete
I don't take it, I make it, but you can't
You can't slip, can't even kiss a freak in your Benz
Please don't try to preach
You couldn't even last a week in these damb streets
Cause you'll catch dots on your face, like acney
Do this shit for fun, you better run like a track meet
Cause you don't want the gun dumped on your tung like ass cheaks",en,"jones ! you understand what's going on right now ? dipset , bird gang , some real geed up shhit listen 305 , all the way to the top eh khaled , what's good ?  rocks like bolder game crazy upstate test the rolls in the lane , racing up the a we betting thousands on street corners roll the dice with police on us slow like the henesy cold tonight , need the seat warmers  slice   4 door , welcome  heavy supercharger goods , no war that's for beginners , i'm living like a winner   you don't want a robbery , nobody trying me looking for some good in me , lil bit of god in me right now , whole lotta shit startin to bother me wanna see some vains spilled , shit load of arteries any rap motherfucker tryna say they hard as me tell the truth , i don't know why these niggas start with me i been in it now , fuck a semi get a rocket launcher , i better shoot your bentley or your hand me downs khaled , you should warn them niggas , ad an extra listen on 'm then figure out who make the paper that say ""missing"" for 'm layin on the top , bigger than a fishing form go and get your whole crew , round up the craziest send them here , i'll send them back and show you what the raiser did we ain't getting paper nigga , you can meet your maker nigga turn you purple and yello , just like a laker nigga  any cat that rap , step to me , i'd catch a felony i just beat a murder , what the fuck these niggas telling me ? i'm not into this rap shit , practicing infedelity these  i could still sell a key i'm the hustler motherfucker , i could sell a tree to the forest , the hardest niggas is with me mad cause they money is funny like bill belomy and wanna put a shell in me , dog but it's all jealousy you smellin me , but you refuse to diss me cause i keep a tool that could fuckin remove a kidnie i keep a 9 , the same kind shyne used for diddy plus i keep the chopper , it pop when i crues the city just in case a nigga get wreckliss , try to test this and i gotta knock out his breakfast out his intestines said i'm on his death list , i don't care what niggas bout if i hear a nigga mouth , then imma air a nigga out  my bro khaled said ""bring the heat"" , birds think i got it , sweet cause i rode with pistol pete , my shit complete i don't take it , i make it , but you can't you can't slip , can't even kiss a freak in your benz please don't try to preach you couldn't even last a week in these damb streets cause you'll catch dots on your face , like acney do this shit for fun , you better run like a track meet cause you don't want the gun dumped on your tung like ass cheaks","['jones', 'understand', 'going', 'right', 'dipset', 'bird', 'gang', 'real', 'geed', 'shhit', 'listen', 'way', 'eh', 'khaled', 'good', 'rocks', 'like', 'bolder', 'game', 'crazy', 'upstate', 'test', 'rolls', 'lane', 'racing', 'betting', 'thousands', 'street', 'corners', 'roll', 'dice', 'police', 'slow', 'like', 'henesy', 'cold', 'tonight', 'need', 'seat', 'warmers', 'slice', 'door', 'welcome', 'heavy', 'supercharger', 'goods', 'war', 'beginners', 'living', 'like', 'winner', 'want', 'robbery', 'trying', 'looking', 'good', 'lil', 'bit', 'god', 'right', 'lotta', 'shit', 'startin', 'bother', 'wanna', 'vains', 'spilled', 'shit', 'load', 'arteries', 'rap', 'motherfucker', 'tryna', 'hard', 'tell', 'truth', 'know', 'niggas', 'start', 'fuck', 'semi', 'rocket', 'launcher', 'better', 'shoot', 'bentley', 'hand', 'downs', 'khaled', 'warn', 'niggas', 'ad', 'extra', 'listen', 'm', 'figure', 'paper', 'missing', 'm', 'layin', 'bigger', 'fishing', 'form', 'crew', 'round', 'craziest', 'send', 'send', 'raiser', 'ai', 'getting', 'paper', 'nigga', 'meet', 'maker', 'nigga', 'turn', 'purple', 'yello', 'like', 'laker', 'nigga', 'cat', 'rap', 'step', 'catch', 'felony', 'beat', 'murder', 'fuck', 'niggas', 'telling', 'rap', 'shit', 'practicing', 'infedelity', 'sell', 'key', 'hustler', 'motherfucker', 'sell', 'tree', 'forest', 'hardest', 'niggas', 'mad', 'cause', 'money', 'funny', 'like', 'bill', 'belomy', 'wanna', 'shell', 'dog', 'jealousy', 'smellin', 'refuse', 'diss', 'cause', 'tool', 'fuckin', 'remove', 'kidnie', 'kind', 'shyne', 'diddy', 'plus', 'chopper', 'pop', 'crues', 'city', 'case', 'nigga', 'wreckliss', 'try', 'test', 'got', 'ta', 'knock', 'breakfast', 'intestines', 'said', 'death', 'list', 'care', 'niggas', 'bout', 'hear', 'nigga', 'mouth', 'imma', 'air', 'nigga', 'bro', 'khaled', 'said', 'bring', 'heat', 'birds', 'think', 'got', 'sweet', 'cause', 'rode', 'pistol', 'pete', 'shit', 'complete', 'slip', 'kiss', 'freak', 'benz', 'try', 'preach', 'week', 'damb', 'streets', 'cause', 'catch', 'dots', 'face', 'like', 'acney', 'shit', 'fun', 'better', 'run', 'like', 'track', 'meet', 'cause', 'want', 'gun', 'dumped', 'tung', 'like', 'ass', 'cheaks']",1,Success & Motivation

It’s the remix!
Ayo Raekwon, we in the jungle with this rock ‘n’ roll shit
I’ma serve the streets with that West Coast Game
I’ma serve the streets with that Pharrell
Shit, I’ma serve the streets with that Busta Rhymes
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi, you know me
How he flying in the air like we ‘Living on a Prayer’, ow
We on the corner serving that Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll, posted on the corner with the Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll

[Verse 1: The Game]
Ayo Chef, let me get my Charles Louboutin on, yeah
Smoking on this Jimi Hendrix, feeling like a rock star
I’m on the block, dawg, leaning on a cop car
Clip the ashes, daydreams of getting knocked off
Most of them niggas be clicking they Tar Heels, Montross
I’m in the Le Montrose, feeling like a mob boss
But I don’t eat spaghetti, nigga, fried wings and hot sauce
Come through the door, get crossed over like Hot Sauce
Warn from the floor, be on the floor with a locked jaw
Told y’all before, man down when them shots off
Why you think I’m leaning on the car? I pay the cops off
Coming at me is like saying toilet paper not soft
Put a hole in one of you rap niggas, not golf
Tell you like ya mama, “I’ll knock your fuckin’ block off”
Rock‘em Sock‘em Robots, you a Waka Flocka knockoff
Say he play the block but can’t get a fuckin’ rock off
Me and Chef, a.k.a. niggas you can’t knock off
[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Wanna talk about getting on when I’m already on
And talking ‘bout cars that are foreign, that makes me yawn
37 years since the first day I was born
The first 17 no jew-els I don
The other 20, outlined myself like Tron
So with life is the only thing I’ll be getting on
The Obama on the arm
While y’all niggas out of time like the hour arm’s gone
How’d this mayne get this bling?
Your bitch like, “How’d this thing get that aim?”
Maybe it’s the private planes or tightest chains or
That’s just the game and I’m not playing, nigga
I shake your hands, nigga, we not y’all
You get beef, niggas’ll heat that up, and eat that up
Pssh, see, that’s us
‘Cause lyrically, nigga, I’m three gats tucked
Nigga, what

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger?
Yeah, I bet it will blast ya
Now take a hit of this Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
It’s some powerful shit

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, fuck a carpet, I’ma roll you out a new rug (Yeah)
Baby, let me introduce you to the new drug (Yeah)
Hallucinate a new visual in a new dream (That’s right)
Then sting your nostril a little like methamphetamine (Shit)
The shit I spit at you on your flesh ‘til you properly rotten
Your cold and clammy skin like you was doing Oxycontin
You see the end results of my shit could be frightening
While you try to kill the pain and I ran in like using Vicodin
Triflin’, wanting every gram that I be slicing
When I feed the street the drug to make ‘em bug and get to pricing in
While I give a Metallica dose, squeeze quick
Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, dope fiend shit (Shit)
Then turn ya to a Twisted Sister, that’s what I do with it (Damn)
Then rubber band the bread, that’s how my Motley Crue get it (Yeah)
That old powerful shit, you know that thing that’s potent (Get it)
That indescribable feeling, that thing that keep you open
We smell that lethal smoking
[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger?
Yeah, I bet it will blast ya
Now take a hit of this Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
It’s some powerful shit

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Uh huh, yeah, under the building shit, word up, ayo
They say he bury his money in gold caskets
Cabinets of rap books, thrown in some bottles that’s drastic
Scientists of war, flows mastered, everybody notice
The rap elite emerge from a grass clique
Gangstas in Polo gloves, no Lugz, Wallabees successes
I be so obsessed with the plugs
Making money, that’s the novel, Adidas sneaker, lethal reefer
Glass cutter, Cecil, that’s the heat, AK pop off
Green beret on, 40 belows, shoulder ratchet on
Low pullover in the hallway, not asking
Finish killing these little weight niggas
Fuck around, get outta place, I’ma do the haircuts and shape niggas
Bubblegum weed spot, last door at the ski shop
The sequel, come smoke with me and my people
We live like them rollers and Vikings
We known for fighting, come float with me like indictments

It's DJ Khaled, we the best
Shareefa, let's take it to the ghetto

[Chorus: Shareefa]
Oh my god, this life so crazy
Hustling to feed our babys
Times get hard, indeed I know
Raised without anything
Go for mine, don't wait for nobody
Tell me who want it, cause nigga I got it
DTP, oh yes it's me
Second time I'm Disturbing Tha Peace

[Verse 1: Shareefa]
Talk is cheap, these bitches ain't valid
She in my lane, nigga I doubt it
Bout my bread, I'm chacing my doe
Always keep your enomies close
Down to ride, your people get ready
That be me in a pimped out Chevy
DTP, oh yes it's me
You can't stop me now, cause I'm hot right now
You can't stop me, no, you can't hold me back
Everytime I try to leave, these suckers pull me back
[Chorus: Shareefa]
Oh my god, this life so crazy
Hustling to feed our babys
Times get hard, indeed I know
Raised without anything
Go for mine, don't wait for nobody
Tell me who want it, cause nigga I got it
DTP, oh yes it's me
Second time I'm Disturbing Tha Peace

[Verse 2: Willy Northpole]
On the street corner, got a duffle bag, boy
A bag of chips, call me the Ruffle bag boy
Yes I'm Cyrus, a hustler's virus
I'm infected, injected, money, power, respected
Necklace gloabal, wreckless flow
X's and Os, thug in the streets
Willy ruthlis, DTP, the money is stupid like dufis
Drop the roof is
The proof is I'm nice in the booth
Rappers get booted right in they tooth
If rappers want to, might as well shoot this
Back on it on the north with the Reefer
An Internet popper, and I can delete ya
I'm from the streets with killers and creatures
And I'm a drug dealer preacher
[Chorus: Shareefa]
Oh my god, this life so crazy
Hustling to feed our babys

Fear in the company now

Don't lose your cold dear
Fear in the company now

Red Light,rap,dj khaled,2008,1837,"[Intro: Game]
(For a taste of your love, for a taste of your love
Just a little taste of your love and your life)
I just want to be known as one of the greatest
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1: Game]
See my mother was a hustler, my father was a gambler
And that made me a scrambler
My grandmother named me game I'm not a amateur
Creep up on my phantom and, I might blam at ya
Hood niggas put your hammers up
A million thugs march picture that with a camera
Damn picture me Floyd Mayweather stamina
Riding with a stallion
Something cute with an Atlanta butt
I could go hammer but I'm not broke
Picture me getting a million dollars for every line I wrote
I'm dope, When J gon' do a song with me
I ain't dope I mean what the fuck is wrong with me?
You act like my polo boxers is a thong you see
I beat on these rappers, hip-hop is Donkey Kong to me
And while we're talking about video games
I'm prestige on Call of Duty, press L2 and aim
[Chorus: Game]
When we see you stop at the red light
And you got your guns on you, what you gon' do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk
When you see me making it rain inside the club
And you mad nigga what you gon do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk

[Verse 2: Game]
I'm not a game you niggas is so lame
My 40 is so aim I will ckk ckk ckk
And if your kids in the car I don't mind waiting
I got 2 sons, I'm not a daddy spending time hater
Got your license plates so you ain't hard to find later
And I got a movie premiere to do so so it'll be some time later
I know the shit coming out of my mouth make the crime grater
But when your the game sometimes you've gotta remind haters
Got niggas that'll find haters
Take you to the LA zoo and feed your punk ass to nine 'gators
I'm an animal, cannibal, can I bust?
Here come LL, don't do it Game trust
This the nigga that rip Mobb Deep
He put the O in O.G
J&J but to win that you got to show me
Matter fact, young Hov gotta show B
That you the greatest of all time
Nigga that's you and Ghost beef
[Chorus: Game]
When we see you stop at the red light
And you got your guns on you, what you gon' do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk
When you see me making it rain inside the club
And you mad nigga what you gon do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk

[Verse 3: Game]
I got a couple rap homies and a lot of rap enemies
But ain't none of you rap motherfuckers no kin to me
Barrel to your throat if you trait on I
Ever disrespect Snoop or, hate on Nas
I'm like the ink then the ink pen
The Juice when you think Gin
I spit bars but nigga, I never think pen'
I only think pen when, when my ass clinked in
And If I'm ever clinked in again let me sink in
I'm so Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio Da Vinci
Just painted the Mona Lisa
My paint brush empty like the mouths in the ghetto
I can see it, my new house just miles from the ghetto
Young black entrepreneur like Cosby and his Jello
Everyone watching Kobe what about L.O.?
Nigga average 14.2 points a game, 10.6 rebounds
3.5 assists, while still on the block
You silly NBA motherfuckers won't even take notice
Man that's fucked up nigga
If that ain't an all-star then what the fuck is?
[Chorus: Game]
When we see you stop at the red light
And you got your guns on you, what you gon' do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk
When you see me making it rain inside the club
And you mad nigga what you gon do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk

[Outro: Game]
Keep thinking I'm a motherfucking game nigga
I play solitaire with this hip-hop shit
Play by my motherfucking self
Keep trying to play me like I'm a chessboard
Imma take your fucking queen nigga
And you know what you can do?

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because.....
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto

Ayo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah thats what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
Thats why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the fourty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga yall made my city bigger dawg
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From compton to being Dre's number one prospect so.....

AAHHAA!!!
Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh
Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there

Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know eachother if not they realated
You can get shot or get bladed
Theres dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
Alot of OG's retired and started smokin
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we dont see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your adress changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared... The ghetto will still be here

Yo the hammer and the muzzle came together
All I had did was hold on to the pieces untill the puzzle came together
Before it all got hyped
I was in the corridor
Apple before it got riped
So I ain't gotta act like
I'm on top of, or in front of them
If I ain't the best dog then I'm one of them
Listenn I'm a different kind of boss
I'm Cut from a different kind of cloth
These niggas is different kind of soft
Everybody know it all
Nobody follow a protocal
The money's only good until you blow it all
Stacking every cents
Guliani knocked John Gotti, What?
So now he's running for president
It's a shame what the game's became
But the truth is
There's really nobody to blame
But the music
Lets give it a minute
Wtih no wack gimmicks
Just hard beats and rhymes
Blow breath back in it

Mutha Fucka i'm the heart and sole of this
You claim king, but we in control of this
Name another rapper you see on the streets
Huggin the block at the height of a beef
Yellow tape and white sheets
Yea that's my back drop whenever I speak
I know alotta y'all would love to ice me
Make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant
Joe's the business, Ask about me
In the middle of the desert
And they still can drought me
You know Coka baby he stay on that new york shit
You see weezy coming down on that forklift
And money ain't a thing, unless he come off with
Then Ima have to hit em with these little bricks often

New york, New York nigga never went no where
I just took off a couple of years
But Now I'm back on my day to day
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day
Who gone tell New york times up, Flava flav
Cuz as much as things change it remains the same
And you can gimme the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mas
An inspiration, the inception, The art..
Of Hip Hip was born
And the rap game was formed
From niggas dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds
And argue all day about who's a bigger star
Joe, Jada, or Ja
SO close but so far
So many there's no star
I can't belive Fifty Cent and NY fell off
And L.A. came back, and the south is running shit
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK

I Dont Play About My Paper,rap,dj khaled,2015,43215,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Future, let's get right to it
I don't play about my paper
(DJ Khaled!)

[Chorus: Future]
Sippin' my cup with this muddy muddy
When I fuck on these bitches, no lovey-dovey
Got a flood on my wrist, I wear Mello Yello
Had a flood on my wrist, I wear yellow mellow
Check on that chick out the melo
I got that white on that white on the Panamera
Lil momma walkin' like Cinderella
See the fire on the pipes when I hit the pedal
I put the racks and the goons on 'em
I got a MAC with a drum on 'em
Soon as the drought hit, we laid on 'em
Two cups of the muddy, I swerve on 'em
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Percocet roxies, we stay on 'em
Them Percocet roxies, we stay on 'em
[Bridge: Future]
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't

[Verse: Rick Ross]
Rich nigga rituals, Rolls Royces and residuals
Residue in my residence, revenue was so plentiful
Rumors Rozay still be runnin' with all you criminals
Ransom notes and repercussions follow my ridicule
Private charters to Bahamas, that's how we send them through
Two new bitches up in Memphis that’s just for summer school
A nigga networth at an all-time high
I play for keeps, you just ran cross my mind (ah!)
I own all the things that these niggas plot for
Know they hatin', still resistin', go and cop more
She takin' off her clothes, know that's for a hot boy
Pistols in the lobby, honey on the top floor

[Bridge: Future]
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper

I Ride,rap,dj khaled,2015,11973,"[Intro: Jeezy & Boosie Badazz]
Yeeeah!
Boosie Badazz, uh-huh

[Chorus: Future & DJ Khaled]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you (fuck 'em)
But really they don't fuck wit' you (don't trust 'em)
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em (DJ Khaled)
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em (Wraith boys)
I still got the paper plates on 'em (money boy)
And if you think I'm playin' wit' you
I'll ride on you niggas (I'll ride on you)
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
(It's We The Best Music)
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz w/ Future]
Boosie Badazz
Boosie Mandela, I am the people's choices
We can take it there, but I take it much farther
Dude you don't know me, so you can't drink my bottle
Why when I was gone you ain't do nothing for my daughter?
Paper plate-living, niggas hating cause I'm ballin'
Boring his bitch, fucked her and spoiled
You don't wanna see me all I do is make a call
We have no specific victims, we want all y'all
Ridin' for the team, .45 wit' a beam
Plenty murder scenes so I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
G-O-R-I-double-L-A
It's levels to this shit like my nigga Meek say
DJ Khaled, look
[Chorus: Future, Jeezy, & Rick Ross]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you
But really they don't fuck wit' you
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em
I still got the paper plates on 'em (What?)
And if you think I'm playing wit' you (Yeah)
I'll ride on you niggas (Waaaaoohh)
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas (Huh)
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
All the bad bitches' real niggas holler when we enter
Sky dweller looking like chilly in the winter
Twelve gauge Mossberg, that bitch look like a chopper
If my dawg burst so I hand it to my partner
Heat game chip bitch I'm chilling on the floor
All white hit the door looking like a kilo
Ice machine refrigerator nigga what the hell
What they said about my watch when I spoke to Gabriel
Cash on the Wraith so this shit is not a lease
Hundred cash on the Cuban fuck I need with a piece
Catch you in the streets knock your top off like a Jeep
Then we show up at your funeral and piss all on your wreath
Ride on 'em
[Chorus: Future & Rick Ross]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you
But really they don't fuck wit' you
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em

I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas (huh)
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Betting on a nigga I'ma go and get it
And if I set it on a nigga you can bet that I'ma go and hit it
These the laws that we live by
Same niggas that you're looking at the ones you getting slit by
Still moving how I wanna
For a brick, whole clique getting left in a coma
White glove it's a deadly game
You gon' fuck, top down say my name like Candyman
Maybach Music
All I want is real estate
Graduated from the corner 'til I send it up the interstate
Niggas hating on me
But I got a new plug and it got a truck waiting on me
M-M-M

I Swear I Never Tell Another Soul,rap,dj khaled,2015,7734,"[Intro: Future & DJ Khaled]
I swear I never tell a soul
Before you know you gotta show me, ya heard me?

On everything, I ain't never tellin'
Ay what it do, what it is? (DJ Khaled!)

Chopper hold a hundred, let off 80

I swear I never tell another soul (I ain't lyin')
These niggas talk just like bitches so
I swear I never tell another soul

Swear I never tell another soul

How to fuck a nigga hate to see a real nigga winning?
I swear I never tell another soul (How to fuck a nigga hate?)
Better ask about me nigga, dope boy shit for real
I swear I never tell another soul (Gotti)
Swear to God touched 10 mil, I swear

Young nigga had no deal, street skills
Big pistols, young nigga so real
If the whole hood know, put the city on his back
And they never took another soul, never took his back

I guess me and you 'posed to be beefin' now
I swear I never tell another soul
I'll bust ya head when the time is right
I swear I never tell another soul
I know a nigga that's doin' life
All because his co-d had four
All his hoe cars and the keys that he sold
That fuck nigga told
His home boy was a D-boy
But he act like a CI, takin' notes like a PI
Carried on like a peon
You see a fuck nigga holler ""FBI!""
I've seen him on First 48
Said he had everything on tape
And he the nigga with the gun with the drum
In his hands hold and fuck nigga turned state
That nigga, that 5-0 told somethin'
'Bout a nigga that put him on on death row
These niggas too cutthroat
And as you knew, niggas got the game all fucked up

I Lied,rap,dj khaled,2015,14873,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
I'mma lie for my dawg, I'mma ride
Just know I'mma lie (DJ Khaled)

[Chorus: French Montana & Meek Mill]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth (Meek Milly)
With my hand on the Bible, (Let me tell you) I lied, I lied, I lied (Uhh)
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I swear I swore to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And I got up on that podium and lied (I lied, I lied)
Then the coppers swore to tell the truth
Nothing but the whole truth
And he got up on that podium and cried
Said I tried to take his life and the judge ain't take my side
Cause when you black, that risk is high
To beat that case against them odds
Against them guys with your last bit of money for your lawyer
My heart dropped when I seen him hit the corner
They was in the black Taurus, Dodge Charger, Explorer
Beat me to the ground and used my blood to mop the floor
But I'mma hold the water like it was holy water
Informants told informants how we had it and they swarmed us
They caught us

[Chorus: French Montana & Beanie Sigel]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth (Uh-huh)
With my hand on the Bible (Uh-huh), I lied, I lied, I lied (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel w/ French Montana]
Only swear by a law so when approached by them folks
I spit the truth when I swore under oath (I lied, I lied)
Shit, cause I don't take the stand on niggas
I rather give it to that man up close (Blocka, blocka)
I told my cellie in the jail I wouldn't rap no more
See you when they free you cuz cause I ain't coming back no more
Wifey on the highway with them kids driving back on fouth
Knowing if a nigga violate that I'd be back in court
Reside in somebody's federal estate
Niggas jumping on your case, worst than First 48
I seen a rat stand up on his case that wish he told
Come on a pill and give a nigga a will

[Chorus: French Montana & Jadakiss]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing (Uh), nah I ain't hear nothing (Nah)
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied (You know my rights)
I swear to tell the truth (Ahem), nothing but the whole truth (Hah-hah)
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss, French Montana, Jadakiss & French Montana]
It was we vs. them vs. three then ten
Swore I never re again but I lied, I lied (I lied)
Now the package is enormous and that come with informants
We already kinda hot so it's stupid to keep it on us
We just being hard headed, disregarding the drop
Them they bagged him in the cab
And brought him back to the spot
Found six P's of piffy, a little under fifty
That little bit of bread make the relationship shifty
And it's all my fault he still tryna to convince me
I miss my goddaughter, I wonder if she miss me
Birthdays and Christmas, I ain't never missed it
Her dad is my brother, I love him from a distance
[Chorus: French Montana & Jadakiss]
I know I told you I stopped (What?) slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing

Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
You know I got that check on me
You know I got that 9 on me
Play with it or get religious
These shots’ll make your shirt holey
Say please lord, forgive a nigga
Actin’ up like Ben Stiller
Jewelry on me so fuckin’ cold
I gotta wear it with a chinchilla
I ball on these fuck niggas, Bron-Bron, D Wade
Whip white like cocaine, too dope, Rick James
I’m hardbody, my flow sick
That Eagle on me no Mike Vick
I bob and weave in that pussy good
And I knock it out like Tyson
Say first round, face down, ass up, straight pound
Yeah shorty, she know the deal
And that’s every time that I come ‘round
This big business, I come around, smoking on that too loud
Give my dog about 1200, in twenty minutes he goin’ down
[Chorus: French Montana]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down

[Verse 2: Vado]
It’s my year, Slime here
Cartier box face, call it the time’s square
Why year, I drive and fly Lear
V-16, need a coupe with nine gears
Yeah! Mob member, star agenda
Serve niggas over these bars like bartenders (Yes!)
I bob cats while shooting like guard Kemba
Hard in the paint, I stretch it, Lew Alcindor
F it, you all dinners, no protection
Tired of hearing these deadlines, no reception
Need work like wi-fi, no connection
We The Best men be the best in, cause

[Chorus: French Montana]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down
[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
They think I’ma gun ‘em down
Just ‘cause I’m a motherfucking king from the underground
Rest in peace Pimp, name live long as Bun around
Niggas know me, 100 keys, 500 pounds
Way too advanced for these lames, had to dumb it down (Mmm)
Nigga try to run off with some change, I’ma hunt him down
All they do is run they mouth; me, I just run the town (Haha)
Cause the industry is being ran by a bunch of clowns
Circus, it hurts cause
Everybody’s a boss and nobody’s the workers (Real shit)
Shit is getting weird
All I know is when I look ‘em in the eyes, they be scared, what

[Chorus: French Montana]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down

I Ain’t Worried,rap,dj khaled,2015,5135,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This We the Best Music, WTB

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat, these niggas get nervous
Ho naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time ain't lyin', y'all gotta be worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
The illest nigga know this, the king cat has spoken
I run the south and you run your mouth
So please quit with the assumptions
Niggas in the Benzo 10-4
Ridin' with the chopper clip extendo
Ain't no game, this ain't Nintendo
Blowing on the highest grade of indo
Rockin' Givenchy, Givenchy, Givenchy
Hop on the beat and I catch me a body
Millionaire hundred million deposit
Just so my niggas, we each can divide it
Talkin' bout money all over the table
Money all over the floor, ugh
Killaz they all in the Porsche
Pourin' champagne on them whores
All my nerves best rolla, Ferrari doin' donuts
Ain't worried bout a damn thing, young nigga big nuts, ha!
Laughing at all you rap niggas out tryna sound like Hood
You can keep that flow, hope it tastes good
[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous
Ho naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time ain't lyin', y'all gotta be worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
First 48, ahah, yeah
I'm a threat to these niggas, it's kill or be killed
On the night he get murdered, I be somewhere in Brazil
The Feds tappin' my raps, got the keys to success
My whole team gettin' rich, I know these haters feel pressure (Woo)
Retaliation a must, put a bag on it, nigga
All day he on Twitter, straight rat on a nigga (M-M-M)
I'm Mr. drivin' my Bentleys, all my foes gettin' mad
Underground I'm a king, posting pictures with Chad
Swisher Sweets in my luggage, Belaire in my bucket
Niggas know where I be, we straight mobbin' like Duddy's
Ace gon' be my nigga, I make him clap through your window
Better watch how you talkin', this SK be a blender, haaa

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried (M-M-M)
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous (M-M-M)

You was never round, had to hold it down
We the youngest, we was thuggin’, you was never found
What’s that feelin’? I’m the realest
All ’em nights I had to struggle tryna find some dinner
They don’t really love me, they not really for me
When I die is you gon’ show up to the ceremony?
I just bought a Bentley just to [?]
Bet you Christian Louboutin’ll make her switch religion

I’m backin ’em down, standing tall like a soldier
These players can’t hold us, it’s the winners’ race
Eating with Kent and Ace at a table, no dinner plates

Have faith in many but put your trust in nobody
Yeah! I said, have faith in many but put your trust in nobody
Have faith in many but put your faith in nobody
I done been around, halfway round the globe, probably
Still ain’t met nobody that see it picture perfect
We all buy lies, depends on the purchase
You can’t walk a mile in my shoes cause I’m steady runnin’
Like water can’t break, unless it’s by a pregnant woman
So I had to earn life, road to the riches
Wouldn’t change it for the turnpike

Would you fuck me for free?
Another one (Another one, another one)
We the Best Music! (Music, music) Major Key! (Major Key)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last two-hundred twenty-three thousand hours
And it's 'cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat-flat
And your ass on ""What's that?""
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl, not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her— man
[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—

[Verse 2: Drake]
Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah, I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood, I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet?
[Chorus: Drake & Complexion]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—
Would you fuck me for free?

They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem (Another anthem)

How we still slaves in 2016?
Key to life, keep a bag comin'
Every night another bag comin'
I ain't been asleep since '96
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt
One on one with the corner with no safety help
I perform like Josh Norman, I ain't normal, nigga
Just a project nigga out in Beverly Hills, California, nigga
That Wraith talk, that's foreign, nigga
Special cloth talk here
All my niggas from the mud damn near
All my niggas millionaires
We gon' take it there, I swear

Another one
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Ain't tryna flatter you but baby you a star
I had to come after you, I seen you from afar
When she walked in I was standin' by the bar
Soon I saw you girl my dick was standin' hard
She so wet I make that pussy fart
Pussy good, I just might buy you a new car
Girl you could come and meet my mom tomorrow
The way you walk I thought you was a model
I'm just a regular nigga from the bottom
I hope you ain't one of them hoes that like to gossip
First I eat it then I beat it just like Michael
Yeah, I rap but I don't consider myself an idol
Ain't wanna say it but I think I like you
Certain shit I just don’t do because I’m prideful
Let a nigga get a little close to you then inside you
It's okay bae don't be scared I ain't gon' bite you
[Chorus: Jeezy]
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in new cars
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
One thing about that sack boy, I'ma run it up
Your favorite trapper's favorite trapper and you the runner up
Free credit, say one bitch, you know I got that sauce
Really got out here and got it I'm a motherfuckin' boss
Cause I call when I call I ain't tryna catch no feelin's
Dick rock hard, yeah I hit her with the buildin'
To all my haters I be mad too, you gotta watch this
Pull up in them 'Raris by the twos just like they chopsticks
It ain't about the sprint lil nigga, it's about the marathon
One time for my city bitch, they love me like I'm Farrakhan
Woke up on the first, yeah I bought a couple bricks
Got 'em all off then gotta suite up at the Ritz

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in new cars
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shawty cause of you, went and dropped the roof
Went and got the loot
Went and hit the dealer, went and dropped the deuce
Tried to make her mine, I'm a hustler lookin' for a buster
Baby go and find 'em, see you on your Oprah grind
We can hustle, both can shine
She buy the payment I knew that
My mind's telling me don't do that, my dick hard so I flew that
That fake love, we grew that
Take off all that Mac and let me see the real
Twisted off that batch I can see your grill
Fuck the blogs, baby chill
I pick these hoes apart
Fuckin' with her mind
So much it started fuckin' with her heart
And I just play my part
I'm just seein' if you real, you wasn't with me from the start
These hoes'll tear your heart apart
Montana

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in new cars

[Outro: French Montana]
I get a way for, and won't pay for and these bitches did't know
I told her take off all that MAC
Lemi see who you are
Even if you love ‘em they gon’ try to play you hard
I pick these hoes apart
Pick these hoes apart
Start off with their minds and then I end up with their hearts
Even though you're famous, I won't treat you like a star

I could have anything I'd want but I still want you
That's the truth
I'm not really into the sentimentals
Just me and you behind the tinted windows
While you throwing all these innuendos
We just finna fuck up all the incidentals at the SLS
That's LA confidential
Show me everything that you've been through
We only do what we meant to like, woah
This that titties on the glass, pull the curtains shit
This that fuck you in the air, no service dick
This that call his ass right now, say you're deserting him
This that call him while we fucking so he heard the shit
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though
I still bless you, but you know what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Money stalking me, its like the money talk to me
So if you ain't talking 'bout money then don't talk to me (shh)
I work with dope boys, I keep a fork on me (skrt)
I'm in my drop top
But won't let you get the drop on me (catch up)
I keep the yop on me and trouble seems to follow me
I take my pistol to the mall, my pistol shop with me
That bitch is jockin' me, and young niggas admire me
Yeah, but I'm a product of the streets so they won't hire me

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Can't let you play me off the streets you know I got kids
And more major keys than a locksmith
I could teach you niggas how to rock this
My bed was a pallet on the carpet
My ride was a bus named MARTA
Pillow full of Estee Lauder
Nigga, I'm allergic to a Charger
Nothing but foreign cars in my garage, ah
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though
I still bless you, but you know what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I'm takin' risks, she takin' pills, takin' pics
Day job night job, Jamaican shit
I stick to the basics, not a basic bitch
You deserve a young young legendary
Heartthrob speeding up your respiratory
Treat these others hoes secondary
I couldn't even cheat with my secretary
Faithful to you even when I'm on road
Even if I'm on a different coast
I'mma still make you feel close, mama
I'm addicted to your ass and titties
When you dance the bedroom turn to Magic City
Got my ass throwing hundreds, fifties
Outta thin air, yeah thats magic tricking
I take you to the Caribbean
Make your mind as clear as the water you swimming in
In and out that bitch like we amphibians
I won't change you up next season
For another chick like they did Aunt Vivian
I'mma put you on the businesses
I'mma divy up the dividends
I'mma show you what the fuck commitment is, baby
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give
Girl you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this feel like déjà vu
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for (work, work)

Holy Key,rap,dj khaled,2016,619646,"[Intro: Big Sean & DJ Khaled]
(This is, this is...)
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music...
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'ma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it

I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)
[Verse: J. Cole]
Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say ""Fuck that shit"" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you would know
The end of your road was chose, by you and not companies
Who control our remote control, and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes, there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other in murky water, I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you 'bout some diamond?
Said all that I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?

Dont Ever Play Yourself,rap,dj khaled,2016,84587,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
D-D-DJ
D-D-DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh
Pat them down count the money, let 'em see the work, yeah
That's the definition of a major key alert
Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first, nah
Won't be the last, all we see is cash, yeah
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (liar)
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure
Was a crack monster, I had the hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask kid
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac, Jada
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back (hahaha)
Either way I ain't never evil
Why do you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em (never)
Heart stops, but the words are forever breathing (forever)
You hatin' cause we the best, find a better reason
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
First thing first don't ever play yourself (ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (it's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself (woo)
See I’m showing the Piguet off, gave the Rollie a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs (nah)
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (swish)
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff (ahh)
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit (yeah)
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets (oh)
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit (oh)
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off
When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off
So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all (nah)
This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls (ahh)
Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him (you can't)
Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (hey bighead)
Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league (hol' up)
Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Mami yellin' I'm the greatest
Back to back with the slow cum
In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her
Every night I meet a new wife
Now ask your wife what this dick like
Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee
Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID
Mami only listen to Romeo
Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo
Bout to let the cans go, woah
Fuck your bitch and let your mans know, so
Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber
Only drivin' Uber cause I'm franchised in Cuba
This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline
Brian Scalabrine, niggas always tryna high five
Gotta stay away from they driftin', all sauce
Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk
[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
(The Conglomerate)
Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin'
Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin'
Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins (closed caskets, nigga)
Prepare for killin', now please line up all of the coffins (Closed caskets, nigga)
Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny?
Pop you in your shit, brotha
Now make room for the money, MOVE!
If you don't make room, I'll beat a nigga past painful
Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful
I get this bread and shine like an angel
One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful
(Thank you so much)
I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas
I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (Mountaintop)
Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas
Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas
I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?
And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too
Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?
You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga
Don't play yourself
Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself, end in a basket
Hate yourself
Cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater
Or you could be you a leader for the people
You talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter
Don't you ever play yourself
[Verse 5: Kent Jones]
I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out
I offered to help you shape up
I see that you'd rather flake out
Sellin' stories on them tracks
That nobody can seem to make out
That's why I keep a good head and shoulders
To keep all the flakes out
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy (haha)
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bench stories, you ain't even part of it all
Start from the bottom or oh, please, don't start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah
Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, and saw
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her
""Please be hammered so you can sex us""
My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be, New Orleans
I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me
So never say my name in vain
Cause bitch there's no arteries

Yo, he ain't messin' with no average chick, pop, pop
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron-Iguodala blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes
Hittin' them home runs, I be like ""Go Mets!""
I want a dude that still kiss me when he mad
Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags

Nas Album Done,rap,dj khaled,2016,302699,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Nas]
A divine leader, shine brighter, bonita mami meeter
Line sniffer, never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show, big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater
So dear, spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty
I'm just a phony assassin, a lot of niggas owe me, I'ma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
‘Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin', my neck was still freezin'
Now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin', it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my ghost supporters, go support us
Like a local Black-owned grocery store
‘Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that, we get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance so we can lease and own deeds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it
[Chorus: Nas]
My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key

[Verse 2: Nas]
Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards
Up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies, niggas is nursery
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy
With a loaded pistol; y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers, check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see

Forgive Me Father,rap,dj khaled,2016,78817,"[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Another one!
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess again
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Don't even look back on it
You ready for change, better act on it
They look up to you so don't slack on it
It's a blessing, you know that you're talented
Some people don't know what their talent is
What's sad is they don't know what balance is
I ain't been the same since I had a kid
Look out for him and protect where I live
I done got famous for what I did
Rollin' up papers and showin' love, we all in the same
Now the bank come to where I live
Don't hate on another man, no that ain't part of the game
Did it all for the fame
And don't call it a game
Started small every day
We worked hard, and now they call us bosses
[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
And I done seen so many people slow down
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
And I done seen so many people change up
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
When you doin' good, somebody wanna see you doin' bad
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
Just movin' forward, so why they wanna talk about the past?
I can't relate, I can't relate, no

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess again
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons

[Verse 2: Wale]
Major, yeah!
I got visions, I miss fortune all day
What I'm sayin', I, tryna tell y'all
I shake these nightmares all day
How can I give you my mind?
When I try to think, it just race
How can I give you my heart?
When I call on it, it just breaks
I put the city on top
District, V.A. all day
PG MoCo on their sweaters
Guess who made their MDMA?
Amy Wine to Cobain
Qur'an, Bible or fate
Try not to feel like I'm Robin Will'
Would a hook change my fate?
Why you make me this way?
[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess of it
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons

DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh
(Just the way)
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no
(They changin', they changin')
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no
They wanna separate it, they try and tear us down
They  tryna tear us down, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Future & Bryson Tiller]
I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's tangible
I'm touchin' M's now my life is pandemonium
I go and re-up on you, new Aventadors
Everything around me too colossal
You niggas old news like a fossil
Every single night I got a bad bitch
She didn't come alone, she came with another bad one
I done caught a vibe and a wave, double jeopardy
They know I'm the king of these melodies
You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key
You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me
Put it in my cup and let me medicate
And it all started off with foreplay (with foreplay)
Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica (Santa Monica)
We was best friends until the fall out
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out
[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh

These niggas beat me to it

They tryna tear us down, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Hey, I been reaping those rewards
From my hard work, I'm startin' to see the jealousy
Hey, they talkin' shit, that's what they tellin' me
What? They rather tell somebody else instead of me
Okay, hey, I got my dollas, my cash up
They wanna see me on my last one (Last one)
They tell you things you don't wanna hear
They don't wanna see me with a bad one
No, or see you in a Benz wagon
With your new bag on
The bag that these hatin' bitches
Only spend a hundred plus tax on
The one we spent five racks on
And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on
I'm the one that niggas love to turn they backs on
Yeah, that's cool with me, that's cool with me
Another one
Another one
[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh

[Interlude: Bryson Tiller & Future]
It's alright, yeah
I'll be alright, yeah
As long as you right here, yeah
I'll be just fine, yeah (I'll be just fine)
Just fine, yeah
Just fine, yeah
We was best friends until the fall out
Just fine, yeah
We was best friends until the fall out
Just fine, yeah
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out
Hey, hey, hey

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
They jealous, they want us to fold
That will never happen
They want us broke, so you know what we gonna do?
We gonna become billionaires
From now on when you see me, call me ""Billi""
I'ma be alright, I'ma be just fine.

Shawty held me down when a nigga had that bald fade (straight up!)

La Flame killin' you niggas, damn, I'm sorry (damn, I'm sorry!)
That's not my kid, call up my nigga Maury (call up Maury!)
Drinkin', drivin', but I wore a condom, man

Bust a band like I bust a kid
Bust a nigga like I bust a bitch
But I pass it like I'm Robert Horry (straight up!)

Ahem
Wayne's world, party time, excellent
She might be a tourist or a terrorist
A Hell's Angel actin' like she heaven-sent, Lord
We can go sight seein' and all that
She can be wifey and all that
She's the tourist, I'm her tour guide
Cause he just bullshit, I hit bullseye
The weed got her lightheaded, red eyes
I told her, ""Don't worry, we stay high""
Plus there's a bed on my tour bus
So you can get fucked as we pull out, Lord
I pull out like skrrt in New Orleans
I pull up her skirt and get gnarly
She come to Wayne's world just to party
And all of my tourists is foreign

Oooh, the nana make him act a fool for it
You gon' need an address when I lose the boy (boy)

One ain't enough, I need two
That night I mix the Ace with the D'US'
Hit a triple-double in the Garden
Held up my left wrist like I'm Harden (swish)
Ran to the dealer, bought twin Mercedes
The European trucks for the twin babies
Don't let me have a son, I'm a fool, haha (ooooh)
Send him to school in all my jewels, haha
I want a boy and girl to fight for truth
Whatever God give me, I'm cool
I've been winnin' so long it's like alchemy
I've been playin' cards with the house money
21 Grammys, I'm a savage, nigga

I know you ain't walkin' 'round talkin' down
Sayin' boss shit when you a runner, right?

Flooded when I got it from Khaled
That was just a thank you for his last year
Next year he gon' have to buy a palace, shinin'

Quavo! I'm the one that hit that same spot (Hit it)
She the one that bring them rain drops (Rain drops)
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (Hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (Hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (Dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up (Bad)
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (Mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up (Cake)
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (Skrrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (Yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (Why?)
'Cause when we pull up—brt-brt!—all angles

When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me

'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody

Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence

[Verse 1: Drake]
I talk gray, I don't keep it white and black
Only say ""I love you"" just so I can hear it back
Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no
Like the album just went platinum, yeah
Turnt up to the max
If they pop somebody's chain, then we gotta get it back
No discussion to be had, we ain't goin' out like that
Man, we lit
[Chorus: 1WayFrank]
My young ni— lit

[Verse 2: Drake & Jay O]
Got it on the dresser, I've been under pressure
They wanna see me laid out on a stretcher
Gotta keep my head up
(Get 'em right, get 'em right
What you finna do, Gus?)
Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins
I keep hearin' all this ""You my brother"" talk, I can't relate to nothin'
My broski down to ride
Made a knot in the line
You can never break ties
We don't really rate those yutes there
That's a whole other side
That's a whole 'nother vibe
They ain't really on shit, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects
I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
(Geek!)
Pay up like I've been runnin' it up forever
I ran that shit up through the roof
Young nigga ran that shit up for his mother
Buy her everything and I got proof
Up, designer fit, ain't known to buy it (facts)
And I done whipped every tire
With the brake pad, ""Mello Yello"", catch up
Ring me up like your pop-pop, whatever you need to
I skeet then skeet off in a new coupe, keep up!
That V-12 'bout to heat up, grab your seatbelt, your seatbelt
The color of my boxers, yeah I'm Tommy'd up
Got the Tommy tucked, ayy
I, toss that shit up like a spray, watch it spill on the clothes
I, soak that shit up when they told me ""Don't matter, boss won""
I, suspended these bitches and I subpoenaed these niggas
To see who was real
I, supported my bank account and I wouldn't tell you the account

DIamonds all on my fingers, misses still miscellaneous
Left the ski-mask in the 'Rari, residencies out in Vegas
Smoking like Calvin Broadus, blueberry with the big homie
Idols becoming rivals, down to die for my survival
Fell in love with the money, she at the spot every Sunday
Loyalty's what I lust, how I measure my woman
Minimize my mistakes, love every tat on my face
DJ Khaled my blood, got several M's in my safe (Huh)

You gon' need a ladder (ladder), work, no acrobatics
Work, no calisthenics, my dick be acting stingy

I'm principle driven, only real ones feel me
Most needed protection from the OG's to get bigger
No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas
Or so we thought speedin' through life like
The speed of sound – what your life like?
Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser
She not askin' questions
Seen the vests, seen other kids in the caskets restin'
Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail
For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck
I gave myself a good hand
Probably ran through a hundred million
Per decade, I'm not phased, and I could spot ya
A hundred million before you could ever spot grays
Chili Fritos in the helicopter
Money can't get that ghetto out'cha

[Verse 2: Nas]
Watch out for insecure niggas
They take your soul out your body, they not secure
I pray the Lord stop a opp before I go backwards
Resort to violent reactions
That's childish, my life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustles (Straight up!)
Niggas movin' bricks
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks
Everybody holdin' shmoney in pics
Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?
All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep!)
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this
Out of New York's biggest and richest
I'm the template, low-key the busiest
The game chose me, deal with it
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic
But silently listen, use the same letters to spell it right
So hear me, from Nasty I'm mature
Here's another appetizer
Khaled, we did it again, let Travis take us higher!

Diamonds drippin' on me, she know who the one
Two-seaters every season and I just begun
Aquafina, she drippin' puddles on a sunny day
Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we could match in my Hermès seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear and like 80 chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches postin' niggas like they was wedding pictures
Evidently, I'm gettin' richer, trickin' seven figures
Ain't no difference when you see me or that's on television
Chasin' a hundred million, baby, my natural ambition, boss

I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stare that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch, get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule
It's only room for improvement
And I realized all I ever needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest, boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me, nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me, nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says, ""You got a good girl, she's a keeper""
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ether'd
Yeah, they don't really fuckin' feel me

I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blindin' their faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can't explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I got something inside of me that can't be quenched
I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched
Go to war for every black queen that they lynched
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
Uhh, after they use you, then they abuse you
Then they get mad when they lose you (excuse you)
You know the liar will accuse you
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual
Anything I touch, I bless it, track record so impressive
Opened the Billboard Awards with a hit record
The devil thought he had me
But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it

Tell em' nobody knows, all my sorrows

Yeah
We the Best Music!
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push—I'm more Eric B. 
I ain't no joke—check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But two million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all greats been driven
G-Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror
[Interlude: Pusha T]
Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said It's Written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat vs Céline, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe Blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push

[Interlude: Jadakiss]
When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence
[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large

Intro Im So Grateful,rap,dj khaled,2017,45256,"[Intro: Sizzla]
Never let me down
For the kings have decreed (bless thy soul)
Righteousness shall be
Show us thy love, oh
Have mercy upon thy soul
Never let me down, no man
Happened today like nothing
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Sizzla]
I wanna say thank you for the time and the love that you share
All the help and the effort just to get me there
When everyone turned their back you showed me how muched you care
You believed in me, never forget you I swear
I'll always be strong, my character defines me
I will never be that hateful and throw stones behind me
Temptation and ego can get you so wrong
A lot of people easily forget where they're comin' from

[Chorus: Sizzla]
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure
[Verse 2: Sizzla]
Hours upon hours searching for a better way out
And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers
Still just gotta look out
Jah is my guide, I know I'm here for a reason
Put my trust in the Most High
And my prayers are so consistent, ah
Who would've thought it would be like this today?
Nothing but prayers lift up your head
Lion in the jungle, I tell ya
He who have been blessed...

[Interlude: DJ Khaled & Sizzla]
Welcome to Grateful
Strength is strength, strength is strength
You realize and appreciate your blessings
Embrace your blessings from the heart
To express your gratitude by doing righteous deeds
Asahd, my son - I love you
Thank you God
I also want to thank all my enemies, for turning they backs on me
Thank you, I'm so...

[Chorus: Sizzla & DJ Khaled]
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul

Squat, shorty, squat, please, in them heels (woo)

She saw the Patek and got undressed for sex ('Tek)
Dinosaur drank, I done found a T-Rex
Unleashin' the beast and I beat on my chest
Ah, uh, step on the peds (step on the peds)
Patek on my flesh (ice, ice)
Lambo wings, fly out the nest
We do not settle for less (who?)
I'm in the ghost with no head (ghost)
I'm thankin' the Lord 'cause I'm blessed (God!)
And some of my niggas, they dead (rest in peace)
Pockets on Gotti, we pull the street in big body
Might pop a wheelie, Kawasaki
We make the profit and cop it, as soon as they drop it
Money fallin' out of my pocket (hey!)

Yeah, yeah
The Patek Phillipe sit right on my wrist
With a super bad bitch eatin' right at Phillipe
Know she fuckin' with a winner
Jewelry lookin' like a slushie fresh up out the blender
Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't
Even if I did, I don't remember
Been a player since the very beginning
Stones in my charm, never my denim, no
Chain flooded like the levee broke, huh, incredible
Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope, shit, let the dice roll
Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh?
Drippin', let you know I gotta go
I catch you anywhere, you get strong-armed
I'm talkin' upstream on a paddle boat
Okay one car, two shoes
You in hot water like a pack of noodles
Yeah, wife-beater, no tattoos
Like Wu-Tang, my cash rules, yeah
Brand new Richard Mille and it's tourbillion (tourbillion)
'Bout to swap the Patek for the Vacheron (switch it!)

A million dollar cash on me in the studio when I did this verse
My money is longer, my weed is stronger
All my bitches is badder, these niggas is sadder
My rubies got chalice so fuck all the chatter
Tissued the money, I rest on them plaques
King of the Patek, clarity showing without even knowing
Jump out that Lambo with the red bottoms on
The capital going up heavy in Florence
Duffel of Franks just to boost my endurance
Two number ones in a row
I sit back on that Act' and sit low in that Ghost
Lamborghini got a S, Sierra Leone baguettes, yeah
The gold from my neck, it done got in my flesh, yeah

My duffel stuffed with a M, yeah

Yo, yo
Queen back in the US, low iron, but you pressed
Who lied and said you next? Crying emojis in my group texts
Stay in your bum-ass duplex, it's Minaj, no group sex
Queen never shuffle, you deal
Just turned down a four-million-dollar shoe deal
Keep your man off my Instagram, bitch
99 problems but ain't one a damn bitch
G4-fly even when I land, bitch
Lookin' like Pocahontas, yeah, they want my land, bitch
I'm just exotic, bitch, chronic bitch
Shoe game on psychotic, bitch
Yes, I am iconic, bitch
P-Pussy get 'em hooked like phonics, sis
Every ball player tryna find this bitch
Ball hard but I'm too fine to fine this bitch
I graduated with honors, bitch
I'm the truth like a motherfuckin' honest bitch
Full throttle switch
Pick a side, pick a side, they gotta switch

And I ain't talkin 'bout McDonald's bitch

I got my car back, I'm John Wick
The sky blue tint come equipped with the convicts
The don's slick, some Billys we gon' get
Broke a leg in my debut, no Bogut (Crack get 'em, uh)
Talkin' sports trades with Pecas
While sides cheat on their husbands, those be the best vibes
Satin grain on the hood of the car
Switch lanes, yeah I used to flood the hood with them jars
You can get a taste for a flat out key
'Cause now-a-days I'm Klay, see my spot up 3
Draped in Hermes scarves, crusing the Riviera
More solid than gold bars, the Billy era

Back of the bag's all crunched out, we vexed too
Should've been Billys in '92, line who? The shine's new
Yeah it's sorta like a mafia movie
Sit back, Rocky and Groovie with the '9-2
Silk pieces in Velez's sneakers
A duffle bag with handcuffs on it, we creatures
Ayo, runnin' every strip club, lit love
Yeah we sit around and just drip bub', the homies get piff love
To all the realest ones and rich thugs
One, my hundred niggas, Billy, we gun on niggas

DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Future]
Fucked the DA on my way here
I made some millions on my way here nigga
I seen your comment on my way here
I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga
Bentayga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun, cock it back and then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sidity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spend three hundred thousand or better, that's on all the cars
The Maybach park itself, nigga
That Range Rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back, I'm eating filet mignon
He been 44'n all year, I put that Rollie on
Trapping good all year, put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets, you gotta keep a drum
Say a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga
I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy, I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind, it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis Ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya (chyea, chyea, woo)
I got the clappers, finessers and the trappers (chyea)
Before the rap change, you gotta go dap em (chyea, chyea)
Don't forget to look at niggas when they after ya (chyea)
[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I told Future I can see the future
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
I know I'm blessed nigga, hallelujah (I'm grateful)
And if you diss me then I might shoot ya (brrrrt)
You don't fuck with me, the feeling mutual (fuck you)
Half these rap niggas owe they jeweler (fuck 'em)
I was selling keys to success
I was coppin' keys outta Texas
New Wraith with the stars in it
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Young shooters, real soldiers put they heart in it
Let's talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' 'scripts and Xans like we're patients
And them fed's allegations will have you pacin'
Million dollar dope boy, I gotta be grateful (grateful)
You tryna get that 100 mil', I'ma race you (race you)
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga (huh?)
Billboard reporter LA Reid just signed a trap nigga
New York Times read Jay Z just signed a trap nigga (facts)

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Ok, now lil' nigga
My clique realer
Thick as fuck. I'm a big tipper
In the club 'bout 20 bottles
I make a movie like Ben Stiller
Chase money, don't chase hoes
That peach Ciroc, I'm on straight liquor
Neck froze like cold winter
Stand by me in need a chinchilla
Presidential got plenty rocks
Roc boy like I know Jigga
Riding off in that new shit
I told the dealer you can keep the ceiling
Plenty bitches wanna get the business
I told them it's my dick decision
Goons with me, need supervision
Murk ya dog if it's slight tension
I hit once and my mind gone
Tipper's short but my dreads long
See a star come make a wish
Come take a flick with ya camera phone
I'm in the club and I'm turnt to the max
Better be pretty, I'm turning 'em back
Clique full of riders you know where they at
R.I.P. Chris, I'ma end it with that
[Chorus: Future]
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest

When this small barol in your face, it look big, nigga
Push big niggas to the point where they don't wanna push small niggas
To the point, get the point, nigga?
Crack dealer I been, since I don't know when
8, 9, 10, na, I don't know when
I know I started early, started young, started dumb
Started out as a runner, started out making my run
I whent from bits and pieces, to bricks and sneakers
Fox was like ""here, give this to Kiesha""
Tell Kiesha to get that to T
Tell T ""get that back to me""
Get the drill sargent, I lay it down like a drill sargent
Straight out of boot camp
My soldiers in the field marching
Hut 1, hut 2, hut 3
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Gotta get it, gotta get it, my money made
Gotta hustle, gotta hustle, gotta hustle, man
I'm on my grind, if I gotta shoot you, I do it, man

Murder, death, kill, anything goes

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Come through on the first?
Good, cause I make my best moves on the first
First of the third, I be workin theGotta break 'm all down, so every person gets surved
I'm addicted to this life for me
I live it, it's just right for me
I can't coap with being broke, I never could
Plus I prommised myself I never would
Plus I can't forget the fact I have that
Wrist when it comes to whippin, bring that Crack back
I'm in the kitchen, I'm whippin, bringing that Crakck back
Cam, pass me the ice, BlackjOr should I say magic
Pardin my slang, it's pardt of my bad habits
Pardin my ring, it's just part of my swagger
You don't like it, nigga, pardin my swagger
I told a chick I'm addicted
To holding my dick with my right hand and posing for pictures
I told her quick ""I'm sort of a pimp, bitch""
Or more of a hustler, and one you should get with
It's none like me
Not two, not three, not one like me
Can't none get it done like me
Not him, not him, damb sure not her like me
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Gotta get it, gotta get it, my money made

Where You At,rap,dj khaled,2006,512,"[Intro: Freeway]
Uh, yeah
Woo! Uh, it’s going down, niggas!
Yes! Khaled! Free!
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Freeway]
It’s that slow flow, F-R double-E, nigga
See them pussy niggas but you can’t see me
I’m sunk in the seat
Clutch my hammer close, I’m controlling the V
And love the cities on both the coasts
But still repping the East, yeah
They like, “Freeway, where you been?”
In North Philly, in the hood, cooking a ki’
Tell me, how crooked is he?
The mayor gave him the key to the city
Then he turn around and flood the city with nickels
To break the cycle, the nine-nickel chrome
The mini-mansion, his home
If Khaled call my phone, I’m in the place to be
G4, the M-I, get high, float in the friendly sky
I’m that fly, tell my pilot the fourth
Far as raps, I murder tracks, Philly
I kill the shit out a sixteen
Shit’s mean, spit a clip for the chorus, I
Tape and record it, put the murder on wax, I
Ship it out to Khaled and shoot a video for it, holla!
[Chorus: Freeway]
I’m from the East where them ARs shooting
Ruthless, niggas will leave you naked, for the record
Khaled from the South where them bammers be moving
Walk into yo’ house and will leave you tied up, for the dollar
Can’t forget the West, where them niggas be looting
Shooting over colors, they will kill ya mother, for the record
And where you at, nigga? That’s where you from, nigga
So rep where you from, nigga, wherever you at, nigga

[Verse 2: Freeway]
My shooter keep it moving, you niggas barely moving
Them bullets almost hit you, you scream, “A-hallelujah!”
I’m on grind, all-time with the Ruger
And Khaled, all these niggas [?], they want me to lose, but
I’m on my Ps and Qs and, I got my eyes open
Can make it happen with rapping, I get my Ps and Qs in
I know Katrina shooting, know Mr. Robert smoking
I supply the addicts, they grab the baggage and keep it moving
Keep it, holding, 6-series, not stolen
Drop the lop look like the roof stolen, call the cops
He be stacking like Lego, leave me holding all the blocks
Run up on him, treat you like the drop, roof open
All them stick-up boys scheming on them fat boys scoping
They be hoping that I’m slipping, I be praying that I’m not
Nigga, ’til then, I’m supplying the block
Free at Last almost here, you should keep your ears open, nigga!
[Chorus: Freeway & Malice]
I’m from the East where them ARs shooting
Ruthless, niggas will leave you naked, for the record
Khaled from the South where them bammers be moving
Walk into yo’ house and will leave you tied up, for the dollar
Can’t forget the West, where them niggas be looting
Shooting over colors, they will kill ya mother, for the record
And where you at, nigga? That’s where you from, nigga
So rep where you from, nigga, wherever you at, nigga
Yeah, yeah, check it, check it

[Verse 3: Malice & Pusha T]
95-South, homie, tell ‘em I’m en route
And I ain’t fronting nothing, neither, that ain’t what I’m ‘bout
No doubt; from Virginia, where the drought never touch us
Them dopes in the pillows, the home of the couch-stuffers
Pop clutches, drop-tops on all you motherfuckers
And all the baddest bitches pretending that they love us
Fucking the soul out us, we call ‘em ""The Golden-Mouthers""
Paying for the service with Louis or Gucci pouches
Send ‘em to they spouses, we back in the street
Cooking up them ounces, from a quarter to a ki’
Call me ""Place-Your-Order P,"" c’est la vie
If you want it, know, I got it for cheap, Re-Up Gang, niggas!
We cock and bang, niggas, we cop them things, niggas
Million records sold and still them same niggas
Bigger picture, grill with the angel fixtures
Where I’m at, they measure worth by your figures, ugh!
[Chorus: Freeway]
I’m from the East where them ARs shooting
Ruthless, niggas will leave you naked, for the record
Khaled from the South where them bammers be moving
Walk into yo’ house and will leave you tied up, for the dollar
Can’t forget the West, where them niggas be looting
Shooting over colors, they will kill ya mother, for the record

Dip Slide Ride Out,rap,dj khaled,2006,615,"[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy
You know a lot of niggas talk a lot of shit a lot of times, you know what I'm sayin'?
But when I come around, man, why them niggas don't be there, man? You know what I'm sayin'?
Why don't them niggas be present then man?
Why them niggas, they talkin' all that shit when I'm here, man?
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: T.I.]
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
I got them guns [?] the back of me
Ridin' down [?]
Gage on the seat, I wanna blow it like a [?]
Take a nigga eyesight, the opposite of Acuvue
My wrath is like Katrina, [?] evacuees
I wild like sporadicly
Jackin' me is actually suicide [?]
Choppers burn up your faculty
I'm mafia, I'm practically better than all them rappers be
You got a problem, need to step up [?] sat with me
Dappin' niggas who trap with me
Overkill, over trill
Flowin' down [?] showin' how them bands overfilled
Over real, I resemble God, I am Lord
Forgiveness is gave, my squad embrace God
Wake hard, take off soft
Metaphorically I sell niggas bricks, then off soft
Eight off boss, I'm so belligerent and diligent
Boot camp soldier, nine months, mind militant
Dro
[Chorus: T.I.]
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
It's Mr. Hurricane, Kuntry King
Rollin' in the black 6
Mr. TIP the king, rollin in the Phantom, bitch
We keep them guns in the ride, even on the driver's side
We can handle any situation like MacGivor
Not to mention the ten Chevrolets right behind us
Ain't a nigga liver, bend it and ride like us
In the club, you see the VVS shining
Champagne and Luie bottles, let the liquor drown us
Let the [?] surround us with haters all around us
All I do is flash a big bank on them towers
Sucker dip, slide, ride out, they game ain't up to par
Like [?] my game is eager for a young trap star
If it's gangsta shit you want, pussy nigga, I'll bring it to you
You want your top popped off, I can do that for you
I'm here now, what you suckers wanna do to me?
Ain't no movin' me and all that talk ain't nothin' new to me
[Chorus: T.I.]
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out

Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Bet you wondering why I'm looking so relaxed in my ride
'Cause it's a AR in the back of my ride
Plus a 9 and a dime on the passenger side
So if a broad ain't find, I'm passin' her by
Wanna live like me? Well, you gotta be fly
A nigga tell you otherwise, the nigga gotta be high
I've accomplished all the things you could possibly try
And aqcuired all the shit a pimp could possibly buy
Set the streets on fire, how can you deny
That I'm the king? Give a damn if you a fan or you not
He a arrogant fucker, but goddamnit, he hot
And all the props he came in the game demandin', he got
Know a lot of people thought that I was runnin' my mouth
When I said I was king and I was runnin' the south
But it's still a few niggas out there runnin' they mouth
They gon' be found shot down with a gun in they mouth, nigga
[Chorus: T.I.]
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out

Tell the chef fix the plate, that be something

And I'm a G, go tell your partners

In a new whip, bumpin throwbacks

Rep Miami, we did it, put all your hope in me
I'm exactly what real niggas is supposed to be
Not the Dr. but it's still Dre
When I be in New York, I tell them I know Jay
You gotta deal with Dre
Bitches love Dre
When you see Dre, what you see is great
No Wilma, no Catrina, no hurricane
Compared to when I blow rappers hands off, I'm rapping soft

I keep my paper straight stackin, and them birds I'm packin
They can't see my mansions, so I give them some glasses
I got a pentiont for slanging pies, turn me up, bump me louder
Beat like the lotto, but niggas don't wanna battle
Imma tell ya like a nigga told me
Don't be dissing on no record, go and see me like a G
Your lil lady loves me
What you talkin bout?
Take a trip to A Town, blow your fuckin brains out

Stay with work, feeling like I'm on the move

Draw flies when you're gift from God

(Best believe Busta got you on this one, homie)
Best believe I'm back
And got another anthem with the baddest
Bitch that's whippin, tryna fuck me in my Phantom
And now she tryna kill me
Like I'm 'posed to cop a plea or somethin'
All in her ass, like I was playing with the wrist
Now it's you and me, ain't nothin' stoppin how we riding out
Shorty unbelievable, the type you fantasize about
Peep how shorty wild 'em out, swag so undeniable
To the point, where shorty beauty undescribable
When it comes to women, we no play
Dem gyal weh' we have ah' di wickedest

You don't no fi see them everyday
But when shorty step up in the club
You need to step up out her way, cause

Bring the Money Out,rap,dj khaled,2010,621,"[Chorus: Schife]
You can catch us in the latest whips, poppin Champagne
Then we hit the strip club, and start a campaine
Bring the money out, bring the money out
Bring the duffle bag, bring the money out
Killing these niggas, bout 3 or 4 chains
Just running the place, bout 3 or 4 thangs
Bring the money out, bring the money out
Bring the duffle bag, bring the money out

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Lamborghini, check
Blue Ferrari, check
Mozzerati Mustang, jumpin out that vet
Fresher than it gets
Louie VVS
Rolli game sick, bluer than the mets
Pull up to the jets
Take off in the next
Feeling like the goldin child, y'all ain't even up next
Shorty she the best, she sexy as it gets
Nothing like the rest, she shake it like Turrettes
Hey hey, my shorty go down
Hey hey, now throw your money out
Catch me at a light strip, if you wanna dip
We don't waist money round here, everything's a slip
[Chorus: Schife]
You can catch us in the latest whips, poppin Champagne

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Boosie Badazz
What what what
Drop drop drop, bring the money out
400 cheese cake, up in my Louis bag
I'm not self righchis, 30 karots round my neck
I don't make it rain, I make it thunderstorm
New whip, back seat with the goons
When I'm in the club, I light up the whole room
Got that Rosay in my hand, down south I'm the man
All these hoes love me, like pussy in a can
Got that house on the hill, dolla dolla dolla bills
You call a stack a G, but I call a stack a mill
For real, I'm on a level with kingpins and mobs
Don't get them choppers, if you ain't coming with them dollas
[Chorus: Schife]
You can catch us in the latest whips, poppin Champagne

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Excuse me motherfucker, my swag got that bird flow
Hurricane Ace here, you should find shelter
Mr. cash addict, you should go and see a counselor
Dump you with no cash, in the river where they found ya
Flowin like a fountin, money getting countless
Mr. don't test girl, my flow sick
I come down for the people, make a mess
I'm the shit period, cold text
And fuck a hater and his thoughts, safe sex
Just bring my money, we don't do cheques
Diamonds on my chest, brighter than a dike vest
This the hood stretched money, bowflex

V12, see ya, 12 (Bye)
I do the whole dash with no seatbelt
Screamin', ""Free my nigga Meek Mill""
Niggas can't wheelie in this free world
Meanwhile Georgie Porgie Cinnamon sendin' me threats
Save your breath, you couldn't beat a flight of steps
Try that shit with a grown man
I'll kill that fuckboy with my own hand
And hop back in the coupe (Woo, woo)
Let's go back to the mud, I'll hop right out the suit
Save all that woopty-woop
Let's let the money talk, let the Uzi shoot
No jewels in this Patek Philippe
It's complicated, three million apiece
Sheesh, that's how we do time
Dujac by the mag, that's how we do wine
91 thousand for a wine bill
Keep it real with you, that was Juan's bill
My whole team ball
Everybody's a star but the team ball
'61 with the thing off
Me and Blue havin' a sing-off
That's a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
That's a vintage piece
Kind that make haters kiss their teeth, you can't buy this new
I had the 'Bach-bach-bach, you know how I do
Two-tone with the powder blue (Woo)
Realest shit to come out the stu'
Khaled is valid, every word is true
What these niggas gon' do without us, Gu'?

Ridin' 'round town with the FLOTUS
One-point-five for the Landaulet
Bey, put these fuckboys on notice (Fuckboys on notice)

How I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room?
I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two
My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat
Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', ""Free Meek""
Two deep, it's just me and Jay
Just posted in them courtside seats
Woo, I'm like, ""hol' up""
Woo, I might roll up
If they're tryna party with the queen
They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure, ayy

I don't know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag

When I get like this I can't be around you
I'm too lit to dim down a notch
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do

Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang
Throw that ass back, bouquet
Call me and I can get it juicy
I can tell you're gone off the D'USSÉ
Careful mama watch what you say
You talking to me like ya new bae
Girl, talking like you tryna do things
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby
You made me drown in it, touche, baby
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby
You know I'ma slaughter like I'm Jason
Bust it, why you got it on safety?

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo!
Mama told you don't talk to strangers (Mama, mama, mama!)
But when you're ridin' in the drop, you can't explain it (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt-skrrt)
What you been waitin' on this whole time? (Yeah)
I blow the brains outta your mind (Ooh)
And I ain't talkin' 'bout physically (No)
I'm talkin' 'bout mentally (Talkin' 'bout mentally)
She lookin', she look like she nasty (She lookin')
She lookin', she look like she classy (She lookin')
She lookin', just look at her dancin' (Look at her)
She lookin', I took her to the mansion (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise
One night'll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby it's a no-brainer
Put 'em up if you with me
Yeah, yeah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
In the middle, woah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh

Yeah-eah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Don't look rich, I ain't got no chain (Huh)
Not on the list, I ain't got no name
But we in this bitch, bitch, I'm not no lame
And I keep it Ben Franklin, I'm not gon' change
Lot of these hoes is messy (Messy)
I just want you and your bestie
Y'all don't gotta answer for whenever you text me
It's multiple choice and they all wanna test me
She ch-ch-ch-ch-choosin' the squad
She tryna choose between me, Justin, Qua' and Asahd
She told me that she love that I make music for God
I told her I would love to see that **** applaud

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise

Off top, drop-top, baby it's a no-brainer

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Walked down, had me sittin' up
Demanded my attention, had to give it up
Look like somebody designed you
Drop-dead gorgeous, you make me wanna live it up
Your presence is critical
Movin' my soul, yeah, you're spiritual
They hate it when you notice me
Like everybody else invisible (Ooh)
Breakin' all the rules (Oh-oh)
So above the law (So above the law)
I'll be your excuse (Damn right)
Uh, and you won’t go wrong, no

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer (No-brainer)
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
(No-brainer)
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise (Rise)

Off top, drop-top, baby it's a no-brainer (Oh, no)

DJ Khaled

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves
[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Hussle, Khaled)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)

They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher (Woah, woah)
(Nip, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle & John Legend]
Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate (Yeah)
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day (Yeah, yeah)
And look at my fate

[Chorus: John Legend & Nipsey Hussle]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Told Khaled bounce the four 'til the bar break)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire

You Stay,rap,dj khaled,2019,411217,"[Intro: India, Jeremih, & DJ Khaled]
Sabes bien que fue un engaño
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Así mismo me engañaste
Y lloras hoy porque fallaste
Cómo tratas de buscarme
Después que tú me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme
Busqué la forma de olvidarte
(Ayy, come here, man, haha)
Ooh
(Señorita, she is beautiful, no?)
We The Best Music (Oh-nah-nah)
Sabes bien que fue un engaño (Oh-nah-nah)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? You stay, you stay
And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

[Verse 2: Jeremih & DJ Khaled]
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & J Balvin]
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day, he'll grow up and be a man
And lately, you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see, I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slippin' at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

[Chorus: Cardi B]
They say my time is almost up, tell them bitches, ""Wish, wish""
All these hoes lookin' cold, all these bitches fish sticks
Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted
I ain't got no free time, all my shit expensive
See my ring, my watch, my chain and everything is lit, lit (Ice)
All this gold on a bitch, I feel like I'm Slick Rick
If they love me or they hate me, it don't make no difference (Cardi)
It be hard not to kill a ho 'cause I be tempted
[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Now I be countin' money, buyin' jewelry, hoes be ridin' dick (Dick)
I just make my M's and mind my business, hoes be ridin' dick (Dick)
""I can see Cardi eat so much,"" and that's what got 'em sick
But I wonder how they still ain't pregnant, all that riding dick
Y'all betta go ahead with that weak shit, I'm certified, real street bitch
Won't be a song if I leak shit, we strapped up like defense
Whatever you do, sis, keep it cute, sis
Leave that beefin' shit at Ruth Chris or end up toothless
I've been official my whole life, I bought burners, I ain't buy likes (Brr)
How did little ol' me get money? Got everybody all tight
These bitches wack, these bitches garb (Garb), they diss me, I disregard
Bet you if I had a dick, these bitches couldn't get it hard

Freakin' you is all I need

I never really met nobody who was truly successful that wasn't thankful (Straight up, woah)
For the good and the bad (Go time)
It made me who I am
Straight up, look
DJ Khaled

[Verse: Big Sean]
When it get this dark, you gotta feel your way out
They tried to bury me alive, I Kill Bill-ed my way out
Letting go of grudges that I used to feel a way about
'Cause some emotions are too taxing to keep paying out
Life is what you make it, I know I'll make it for sure, then make it some more
I know critics hate it galore, it doesn't phase me no more
I know some peoples only taste of success is the bite that they take out of yours
My GG told me God laugh at you when you make plans
The type of wisdom that made us men
Plus tryna thank everybody who helped us along the way
Is like trying to name every single member of the Wu-Tang Clan
Yeah, I might skip one or two
But that doesn't mean they wasn't just as part of the plan
Some love goes without saying
Who would've thought that DJ that was on 6 to 10
Right there on 99 Jamz, screamin', ""We the best""
Would've had all the execs eatin' right out of his hands?
Showed us all the keys to success from doors being slammed
Look, I gotta thank Khaled, who back in 2010
Convinced Ye, Sean should drop ""My Last"" shit
It's a smash hit, add Chris to it and it's a classic
That's that rare shit, yeah loyalty everlasting, look
All I know, forever stuck to the code
Only one I changed was 48221 to 90210
Fast forward later, this nigga Khaled my neighbor
The type of stories that you can't make up
The universe doesn't just work it out, man, it works in our favor
What's Heaven on earth, getting everything that you prayed for?
Shit, believe it to achieve it or you never will
On the phone with Colin Kaepernick
He like, ""They not gon' make it easy for us in this game and they never will""
I'm like, ""That's not just the NFL, bro, that's every field""
Look, no restraints, bitch, only strength
That's my wavelength, surprised I ain't go insane
Heard more gunshots outside than the doorbell rang
And swam with sharks that's too big to fill up tanks
And I'm right here, right now, how could I not give thanks?
Feel my pain, I paint these pics, I spill this paint
I miss my dogs, I spill this drink
I pray that all your growing pains turn gold champagne
Plus I gotta thank my exes on some ""thank u, next"" shit
And all the old times that gave me new perspectives
Speaking of new, I'm about to ink a new deal, Don Life Records
And put anyone on in the city who needs connections
This that Fortune 500, my shit never plummet
I just bought a mansion and moved in the dungeon, don't none of y'all want it
So all y'all fuckboys that want us to fuck up
Just know I made five hundred plays and not one of 'em fumbled
My vision is tunnel, Sean Don
[Outro: Big Sean]
And I just gotta give thanks
'Cause it's that time
You know what I'm talking about, that grind time
You've been grinding your whole life
It's that time where that preparation meets that opportunity
And you gotta be ready
And give thanks",en,"i gotta give thanks , you know ? i never really met nobody who was truly successful that wasn't thankful  for the good and the bad  it made me who i am straight up , look dj khaled  when it get this dark , you gotta feel your way out they tried to bury me alive , i kill bill-ed my way out letting go of grudges that i used to feel a way about 'cause some emotions are too taxing to keep paying out life is what you make it , i know i'll make it for sure , then make it some more i know critics hate it galore , it doesn't phase me no more i know some peoples only taste of success is the bite that they take out of yours my gg told me god laugh at you when you make plans the type of wisdom that made us men plus tryna thank everybody who helped us along the way is like trying to name every single member of the wu-tang clan yeah , i might skip one or two but that doesn't mean they wasn't just as part of the plan some love goes without saying who would've thought that dj that was on 6 to 10 right there on 99 jamz , screamin' , ""we the best"" would've had all the execs eatin' right out of his hands ?

Tormented soul, tormented soul, go away
Go away, go away from me

How they kill, name and torture and use the name of Christ

[Verse: Buju Banton]
Where thou standeth is holy ground, yeah (Holy ground)
Where I standeth is holy ground (Holy ground)
I shot him down to the ground, never to be found
No wickedness, only righteousness
But I shot him down to the ground
With word, power, and sound
I fear no evil ground, no, no
Have you ever heard it was written? (Written) Yeah, yeah
Just like the anointed, your judgment shall be tripled
Lord, God
Where thou standeth is holy ground, remember that (Holy ground)
While I standeth on this holy ground (Holy ground)

[Pre-Chorus: Buju Banton]
A rebel is a warrior, just give him a cause
No more badass, no more wars
The state of play ain't pretty over
But a real soldier keep marchin' on
Let not another generation face this evil oppression
Or stay incarcerated, feeling nice in all black
The poor still living in a state of shock
The time you took I know I will not never get back, but

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
You can see the pain in my eyes
See the tracks in my tears
Feel it deep in my body
You don't know where I came from
I can't go back, no, I can't run
I won't do that for nobody
This world's so cold
I can't ever break my code
You won't ever take my soul
You won't ever
And I'm all alone
I ain't got no one to hold
But you won't ever take my soul
You won't ever take my soul
You won't ever
[Verse 1: Nas]
Love is a myth, unless it's your mother, father, and kids
You beg to dif'
Forgive 'em for their ignorance
They not rememberin'
I gotta give them their discipline
Remember when I used to suffer
Struggle through daily pain?
I got it good now
I'm talkin' a mental plane
Silencin' all the noise
Pray for the day I bust a nina on that bitch who shot Selena
Then I rejoice, uh
We some fathers to our boys
Birth a boy, you rich for life, see the joy
I live to see my kids doin' business
Tell 'em everything's business
Basically, everything's a business
So make it your business to get it

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
You can see the pain in my eyes
See the tracks in my tears

I had no Damon Dash as my partner
Just maniacs, wish I had a Damon
I woulda been straighter with that shit
No Puffs, I had crack sellers to trust
No Suges, not even no havin' your shit when we change
How the patterns go
Free Bill Underwood
Morris Levy was free, grabbin' dough
Status quo straight from the barrios

To all my dawgs CEOin'
P and Coach K and Top Dawg, see, we growin'

Holy Key Demo,rap,dj khaled,2019,1808,"[Intro: Big Sean & DJ Khaled]
Woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah (This is)
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music
Oh, I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'ma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates (straight up)
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (sheesh)
'Least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested (yep)
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach (beach)
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in (brr)
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
You made it up while we made it happen
I kill shit to just kill time, no chill time
In the field on time every time like it's drill time
I took a break from my girl so she still fine
Took a break from the game, but it's still mine
Got my big break, now we tryna break the records
These niggas couldn't take the pressure that I ate for breakfast
Pretty girls showin' love like I'm David Beckham
The takeover will only take a second, straight up
[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key

DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Post Malone, DJ Khaled, Post Malone & DJ Khaled & Megan Thee Stallion]
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it (Ayy), I did it, I did it, I did it

[Verse 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
Take it off then bend over, let me see it
If you're lookin' for a trill type bitch, let me be it
I'm from the South, never had a handout
'Fore I let my people starve, I'll take it out your mouth
These bitches so quick to switch up
I'm from the Lone Star, I don't need to clique up
It ain't directed, so it ain't respected
Stop droppin' clues 'cause I ain't no detective, bitch
I'm tryna win, don't care how I do it, just know that I did it
Why you so worried 'bout what I be doin'?
Countin' my money ain't makin' you rich
Talkin' down on me don't make you the shit
How my name in your mouth more than your spit?
I really encourage my haters to talk
Throwin' that shade only keepin' me lit, huh
[Chorus: Post Malone & DJ Khaled]
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Hey, goddammit, I get it
They don't like to see when we win, but I did it
Hey, I stand by my city
Chopsticks sound like a guitar in the air
Stop and take a picture when I'm jumpin' off a Lear
I done ran it up, it only took a couple years
The money be callin', if it wasn't for my lil' partner
Then the bullshit they be talkin' 'bout, I wouldn't even hear
New sports car go, ""Vroom,"" switch gears
Hey, how you? Goddamn, come here
Thought of goin' vegan, then again, I'm like, ""For what?""
I got ten karats each in my left and right ears
'21 Tesla, I don't even gotta steer
My climax ain't even nowhere near it
I stayed down and I stayed down
And I came up, I had faith in my spirit
[Chorus: Post Malone, DJ Khaled, Post Malone & DJ Khaled & DaBaby]
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it (Go), I did it, I did it, I did it

[Verse 3: DaBaby & DJ Khaled]
Diamonds on my neck
New contract, I ain't signin' that ho yet
Private plane flyin' somewhere, smilin' on the jet
I drop hit after hit, now that's the domino effect
These niggas out here goin' flat
Ain't no stoppin' it, pink and blue paper all day like Monopoly
Brand new Pradas, I'm proud of me
Actually came from the bottom
Ain't no need in even askin' me, ain't even seen the half of me
And ain't no passin', that's a no-go
Start them killer player niggas out here throwin' low blows
I done got good with the shit
I tell the paparazzi, ""Get my angle,"" every time they take my photo (Another one)

Stayed down 'til I came up

And I know that somebody been praying for me
Head above ground and I could've been six feet deep
Out on these streets, when I get down on my knees
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)
I'ma blow this bag for everybody who counted me out
And I still got love for all my dawgs who holding me down
Head above ground for my niggas and my dons
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)
[Verse 1: Jeremih & Choir]
I done dodged a few heartbreaks, yeah
Never lost a thing I can't replace yet
Couple times, thought I wouldn't make it (Thought I wouldn't make it)
Then I came up ten toes out thе basement
I done had to mutе, fuck noise
Did a couple things, they left me no choice
I done hit some licks that my mama won't be proud of
Said we gon' be rich, give her something she can smile for
The devil on the block and he lurking
Tryna hit me up with a dozen
But when I look around, shit ain't worth it
That's for certain, yeah

Seen white chalk make street angels
You're welcome, look down, feet dangles
Be proud, be shameless
Yeah, be now, be ancient
Yeah, it been my turn, let me cut off these blinkers
I cut off these strangers and ifs ands and buts of the strangers
I never relinquish, I'm thanking Franklin as an acquaintance
Destiny danger, I done seen from every angle
From my neck to my ankle, the spots on this leopard ain't changing
Nigga, that's for the wankstas, 50 told me that, I say thank you

Sometimes it's sunny, but sometimes it don't shine (No, it don't shine)
And life is a bitch, but sometimes it's alright (It's alright)
So I'ma let go of things I can't control
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & 21 Savage]
Let it go (Oh-oh-oh), let it go (Oh-oh-oh)
Let it go (Oh-oh-oh), let it go (Oh-oh-oh)
Let it go (Oh-oh-oh, 21), let it go (Oh-oh-oh, on God)
Let it go (Let it go), ooh

[Verse 2: 21 Savage & Justin Bieber]
I'll let it go if you say that you love me, that shit better show (On God)
Don't try and play like I'm slow, 'cause you been 'round the block and I know this for sure (21)
She ask for seconds, I give her some more and I'm proud of myself 'cause I used to be poor
Now I just hustle and grind and stack it 'til all of my muscles is sore (On God)
Don't play a sport, but I ball (21), answer the phone when I call (21)
I get up whenever I fall, don't try me, it's gonna end up in a brawl (On God)
Porsche lights look like a frog (A frog), cost a few hundred, that's all (That's all)
Richard Mille sit on my wrist, I'm big 4L, I don't do shit small (On God)
Ass so fat, can't sit up
Shawty got a load in the back like a pick-up
Quarter million dollars every time I do a pick up
Fans got they arms in the air like a stick-up (21)
Money growin' like it got hiccuped (21)
You know it's some dope if I whip up (Straight up)
Time is money, lil' baby, you beautiful
I ain't got no choice but to tip ya (21, ooh)

Has gotta make the bad days worth the tears

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Lil Durk]
Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, ""I’m the one,"" they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, now they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathin'
They makin' it hard, this shit really easy, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby, DJ Khaled & Lil Durk]
Yeah, she think I'm a regular rapper, I'm not
One person come tell me we fuckin', you blocked
Watch me run this shit to the tippity-top, yeah (Keep goin')
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support your personal needs
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These niggas be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat
Soon as I get on his ass, they gon' look at me better, like, ""Damn, he was fuckin' with me,"" yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist

You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm from the trenches
Niggas be tough on the 'net, but really be there for attention
Well, bitches be talkin' like they really rich, but really be beggin' me under my pictures
I'll give her forty, fifty thousand cash to start up a business
I'll spend that shit at the dentist
I'd rather fuck her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me shit
Goin' to Cali, I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me shit
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me shit
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the lo', ain't no room right now, I took her to the O
Then I pulled up on the Lam' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, fuckin' up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry, I'm standin' on all the blocks
This the anthem, mmm-hmm
Droppin' the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats, remind me of sittin' on panda, mmm
I love my cousin, she was a dancer
I love my brother, he was a scammer
Sittin' on my lap 'cause I'm pullin' her tracks and I fuck from the back 'cause she callin' me handsome (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist

I brought her into the night, I need you here right under me
Girl, I'll keep you company, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Girl, you gotta ride, look in your eyes
It's like I could read your mind
And we've both been saying, ""It's time you put it in reverse and ride""

Body in motion
You got me so damn focused, yeah
Baby, I'm so done with waiting
Ain't no problem, I'ma give you your way
Got me intoxicated

You should reach out and take it
And I'm getting impatient
Reach out and take it
Give you your way
Body in motion (We the Best Music)

This that hard work, dedication, shit you can't deny (Yes)
I'm my only enemy, if I don't win, it's self-sabotage (That's on me, yeah)
Bitch, I'm in the zone and it's a warzone (Doot-doot-doot)

Runnin' through the courts, made it playin' like a sport (Huh)
Set the streets on fire, left it burnin' like a torch (Take that)
All I want is two-doors, gave the charges to the boys
Now I'm bigger than the blogs, now the topic on the Forbes (Woo, come on)
Catch a fed charge, now we pardoned by the laws
Niggas better stay in line or I'ma sit 'em in the morgue (Come on)
Heaven on earth, half a million on a watch (Watch)
Three bands on a sweater just to let a nigga watch (Boss)
Nigga wanna ride the wave, so I let him hold the yacht
Cuban links for the team, double M on the lock (Double M)
305 the code if you wanna get a block
You can send in Bitcoins, time to triple it with stocks (That's right)
All eyes on me, you niggas livin' in a box (Huh)
Got the haters leavin' comments while I'm really sendin' shots (Biggest)
[Interlude: Diddy & A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ayo, I told y'all the motherfuckin' first time I was never gon' stop, yeah (Love, love in the sky)
Ten years from now it's— but that was thirty fucking years ago, motherfuckers (As I kiss your bitch goodnight)
Get used to it, like the fuckin' air you breathe
The first shall be last and the last shall be first (Love, love in the sky)
Black motherfuckin' rich shit (As I kiss your bitch goodnight)
Ownership shit

[Verse 1: Nas]
Hear ye, hear ye, only kings stand near me
Silicon Valley money mixed with Henny, that's Effendi
Half a century almost, sliced the green like a lawnmower
'Til we all on, never fall off, hear a boss talk
You don't hear me? That's your loss
Winner in life, fuck a coin toss
I'm coin-based, basically cryptocurrency Scarface
Join us, there’s gotta be more of us
I’m from the ghetto, what location? Two seconds from the Devil
I live heavenly in Cabo, with a Mexican sombrero
Drink heavily, health is wealth (Health is wealth)
Look at wealthy me, wipe your nose, HSTRY my type of clothes
Miss me with the hate, helped so many people get cake
Whips in cream for the crew, no other weed, I think faster
The time I spit this, I started some other business (Some other business)
Came from the pitchin' (Came from the pitchin’), 'caine in the kitchen
Dangerous missions, wastin' your time if you want my forgiveness (Forgiveness)

Hater know not to touch me, I'm with the fuckery (Fuck with me)
Humbly (Humbly), nah, respectfully
I'm a project baby, fuck y'all expect from me? (Technically)
'Merica's disrespect for me
You killed Christ, you created religion, unexpectedly
Circular ice on Japanese whiskey, on my mezzanine
Overlookin' the City of Angels, the angel investor in things
Unprecedented run (Facts)
Everybody's gettin' bands, we just dance to different drums (Bram, bram, bram, bram, bram, bram)
I like who I've become
Intermittent fasting, but these meals, I'm not missin' none (Sorry)

Yeah, I know you're tired, baby
Yeah, I know you're so tired
Yeah, help has arrived, baby
Look up in the sky
Know you wanna fly (Know you fly)
Know you're trying your hardest to get by
Yeah, I could see it in your eyes
I could see it in (I could see it in)

'Cause I can have it all

And I can have it all
I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all

DJ Khaled
Yeah
[Verse 1: H.E.R. & DJ Khaled]
Knew I was special from a young age (Come on)
Knew I would take some shit to my grave
Hope that the problems that I became to some niggas that I snaked
Don't catch up to me someday
But karma my bitch and she working for me (What else?)
One time for the niggas who still adore me (What else?)
'Cause it's some broads out here fucking for forty
And I'm just tryna make somebody son fall in love before forty
I been on some wild shit (Wild shit)
Coming out the bank with a mortgage deposit (Deposit)
Made myself a promise I'ma win
(I'ma win)
Never again, broke up, broken hearted

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
And I'm staring at the fountain blue from the balcony
Running a mile or if I was tryna chase a dream
'Cause I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
Ain't got no hate in my blood or no jealousy
Know it's somebody, it's somebody out there just for me
And I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)

[Post-Chorus: H.E.R.]
I could feel it in the air (The air)
[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, riding with my billionaire homie, I got the Glock up on me
He always asking me why I got it? Be tryna hide it from him
He told me ""Why don't you get some security? You got a lot of money""
But I can't get this shit out my heart that took my father from me
Shit, do you know the feeling of success?
When you young and you black but you stressed and you blessed
And you gotta wake up every single morning, do your best
And when you get your cake up niggas gon' try you on the 'net
I had to switch way up 'cause I can't die by my respect
I got kids I gotta feed, I got a momma that can't grieve
When it was slow and niggas left, I made my mind up, I can't leave
Plus homie doing life, shit, I got guys that got free
Juveniles don't get no life at seventeen, he was eighteen
They gave him life so we gotta pray and believe
And try to squeeze on every resource that we know that he need
We must achieve
And once we see him we gon' go and succeed
The heart of Creed, I'm from Philly, nigga

[Bridge: H.E.R. & Meek Mill]
From the balcony I see the fountain blue (Know where I'm from)
Over the bridge is muddy waters, 'til your dreams come true
But I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
From the balcony I see the fountain blue
Over the bridge is muddy waters, 'til your dreams come true
But I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
[Verse 3: H.E.R.]
Who knew it would be worth all of the losses?
Hopped in the Bentley, ain't even worry what the cost is
I know you out there tryna sell your soul for profit
We gotta count all of the blessings 'cause it's God sent
Standing on the edge right now
I said I'm standing on the edge right now
And if the walls come down
If it all come down
If it come down

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Staring at the fountain blue from the balcony
Running a mile or if I was tryna chase a dream
'Cause I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)

Flooded my wrist, if you play, you get candle lit (Buck, buck)

DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Cardi B]
I get big paper, so I deal with big haters
Bi-big paper, so I deal with big haters
Bi-bi-big paper, so I deal with big haters
Go-go-got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
It ain't a bitch like her, that's why these bitches don't like her (Nope)
I respect shit-starters, not no shit-typers (Uh)
Three-year break, I still get this shit hyper (Woo)
Shot back to the top, don't make a bitch snipe ya' (Grr)
Big Bardi, they can't fuck with me, hardly (Woo)
Body anybody sayin' they don't know my body (Uh)
I son bitches, movе Kulture out the car seat
Got thеse hoes nervous, I can spit it to their heartbeat
Super valid anytime I link Khaled (Woo)
Platinum plaques hang on every wall in my palace
Clips still push, to anybody speakin' malice
Fashion icon, couple million for my stylist
Five number ones, you got five number nones (None)
Sleepin' on Cardi, all that nappin' shit done (Done)
Off with your hat, all that cappin' shit done
And I got Hollywood waitin' when this rappin' shit done
[Chorus: Cardi B]
I get big paper, so I deal with big haters (Yeah)
Got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors (None)
Got it out the club, they ain't do me no favors (No)

Big paper, so I deal with big haters
Bi-big paper, so I deal with big haters
I get big paper, so I deal with big haters
Go-go-got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
The most imitated, innovated, instigated
Playlist favorite, your shit, never played it (Nah)
Had to make a way and your shit never made it
I was broke in the Bronx, but a bitch never hated (Never)
Had to get my weight up, so I patiently waited
House with the palm trees for all the times I was shaded
Niggas out the woodworks, no, we never dated
Stop lyin' on the pussy when you know you never ate it (Pussy)
Took the wig off and braided back my hair (Woo)
Mixtape Cardi, like I ain't a millionaire (Ha-ha)
Big diamond single, big diamonds in my ear
And my stock steady risin', you would never get a share (No)
Ridin' nigga faces, I don't never get a chair (Ahh)
If I don't take a break off, you would never get a year (Never)
Prayin' on my downfall, you never get a prayer
Had to tighten up my circle, so I never fit a square
[Chorus: Cardi B]
I get big paper, so I deal with big haters (Yeah)
Got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors (None)
Got it out the club, they ain't do me no favors (No)
Cardi this, Cardi that, make me more famous (Woo)

[Chorus: Drake & DJ Khaled]
No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new (DJ Khaled)
Still here with my day-one niggas

[Verse 1: Drake]
Man, this shit so ill that we had to restart it
H-town my second home like I'm James Harden
Money counter go *brrrr* when you sellin' out the Garden
Four-car garage, pornstar ménage
Birdman go *brrrr* 'cause he know this shit retarded
Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed
That's what yo' ass really call started from the bottom
Yes, Lord, OVO Sound, man, I'm proud of my niggas
Knew that we would make it, never doubted my niggas
All my bitches love me; if I had a baby mama
She would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas
Ayy, that's luxury, dawg
Day-one niggas, man, y'all stuck with me, dawg
Ever since YouTube, niggas been callin' me the leader of the new school; fuck with me, dawg, yeah

Your bitch all in my photographs
Ho niggas got hate for me
Big homies all certified
Nothin' niggas gon' take from me
Follow codes, study game
Feed fam, nigga, fuck fame
All black, my whip foreign
These bad hoes keep tiptoein'
Down in Turks and Caicos
Dope boy, that's my dress code
All I hug is blood, nigga
Khaled, that's my flesh, ho
All I want is love, nigga
Money bring that stress though
Smoke good, I love life
Strip club like e'ry night
E'ry night my same niggas
Day one, straight menace (Rozay!)

[Chorus: Drake]
No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new (Huh, Maybach Music)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas
I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name
Well, that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hatin'
I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies
I wish we could trade places
Bitch, we good-fellas
Boy, all them niggas with you, they just pall bearers
And if we ball, catch us
Remember sip slow, live fast

Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different ****
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get 'em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It's the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis' and 'em doin' aight
My cuz and 'em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, ""I'm the one,"" they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, now they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathin'
They makin' it hard, this **** really easy, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that **** hurt my wrist
All these **** on us all, I wish I would claim that ****
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that ****
You can miss me with that ****, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and ****)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and ****)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby, DJ Khaled & Lil Durk]

One person come tell me we ****, you blocked
Watch me run this **** to the tippity-top, yeah (Keep goin')
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support your personal needs
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These **** be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat
Soon as I get on his ****, they gon' look at me better, like, ""Damn, he was **** with me,"" yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that **** hurt my wrist
All these **** on us all, I wish I would claim that ****
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that ****
You can miss me with that ****, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and ****)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and ****)
[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm from the trenches
**** be tough on the 'net, but really be there for attention
Well, **** be talkin' like they really rich, but really be beggin' me under my pictures
I'll give her forty, fifty thousand cash to start up a business
I'll spend that **** at the dentist
I'd rather **** her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me ****
Goin' to Cali, I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me ****
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me ****
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the lo', ain't no room right now, I took her to the O
Then I pulled up on the Lam' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, **** up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry, I'm standin' on all the blocks
This the anthem, mmm-hmm
Droppin' the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats, remind me of sittin' on panda, mmm
I love my cousin, she was a dancer
I love my brother, he was a scammer
Sittin' on my lap 'cause I'm pullin' her tracks and I **** from the back 'cause she callin' me handsome (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that **** hurt my wrist
All these **** on us all, I wish I would claim that ****
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that ****
You can miss me with that ****, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and ****)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and ****)
