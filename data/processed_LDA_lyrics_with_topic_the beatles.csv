When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom, and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Now, Helter skelter

Yeah
Woo

A Day in the Life,pop,the beatles,1967,691544,"[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on
(Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten)
*alarm clock rings*

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

You Never Give Me Your Money,rock,the beatles,1969,146719,"[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags, get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away

Came true today
Came true today

Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door

Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there

Happiness is a Warm Gun,rock,the beatles,1968,227203,"[Verse 1: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me
[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]

Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)

Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday

Dripping from a dead dog's eye

Norwegian Wood This Bird Has Flown,rock,the beatles,1965,284849,"[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
""Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?""

So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, ""It's time for bed""

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Rocky Raccoon,rock,the beatles,1968,261456,"[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

Changing my life with the wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

An octopus's garden with me

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe (Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do

Roll Over Beethoven,rock,the beatles,1963,22347,"[Verse 1: George Harrison]
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I've got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught off the writer
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two
[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6: George Harrison]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
As long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

No Reply,rock,the beatles,1964,27308,"[Verse 1]
This happened once before when I came to your door

With another man in my place

I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know

If I find her, I'll be glad

There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself

Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Ooh!

Ooh!

Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop

Who sometimes wears it twice as long

From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

Deep down in Louisiana
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens

Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode

To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy

As sweet as you are

Nothing you can sing that can't be sung

All you need is love
All you need is love, love

Each and ev'ry day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me to, ohohoho, oho
And when I ask you to be mine, ahaha
You're gonna say you love me too

And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Oh!

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah!

Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride

(J): Wonsaponatime, there were two balloons called
Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
In a million years. They were together man. Unfortunatimetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
Kept calling them one way oranother (you know howitis)
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities
Including some of there beast friends. Being in love
They cloong together even more man. But some of the
Poisonessmonsters of outrated buslodedapethrowers did
Stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
The dry cleaners. Luckily this did not kill them and
They weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
Hopefully ever after and who could blame them

Time is here again. Ain't been around since last year

Worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who

Long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence

Disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, hoc virtallo a totem. On the other handbag, I mean to say

For this film is about an hourglass houseboat. The full

Loss was our Gainsborough nil

Now ... exactly the way I did it then

I find the things that you do

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques'fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
And lastly through a hogshead of real fire

The Beatles Christmas Record,pop,the beatles,1963,2606,"[Paul] Hoo!

[All]
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!)
As the slow ray round about
Deep and crisp and crispy
Brightly show the boot last night
On the mosty cruel
Henry Hall and David Lloyd
Betty Grable too

[John] Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show

[All] (whistling)

[John] This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:

Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too
[Paul] This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing

[John] Yes! Yes! Oh yes!

[Paul] Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...

[John] Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!

[Paul] ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...

[All] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!

[Paul] ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription

[John] Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon
Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy
Danke schon

Ja, Ringo!

Hello, Ringo here
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups...

(Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas)
Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted
(Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas)
King Wenceslas:

Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)
Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!)

Hooray!

Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters
And I'd just like to say:

Brightly was the shone that night
Though the winter cruel
When a pork pie came inside
Gathering winter cruel

Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!)
Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!)
When ev'rybody picked it...

Ha, ha, ha, ha...
Oh yeah! Oh!

Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!)
Had a very shiny nose

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup

Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene!
Over men and horses, hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring
Don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course, Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
La la la la la la la la la la la
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. Kite performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation

Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot

[Chorus:]
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away
[Chorus:]
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Pre-Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
And everyone knew her as Nancy
She and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
Now, Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 3]
I look at the trouble and pain that is raging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

Take two? (Okay)

[Verse 1: Lennon]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in

Don't you know it's gonna be, all right
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right
[Verse 2: Lennon]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can
But when you want money
For people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait

[Hook: Lennon]
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right
Do you know it's gonna be, all right
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right

[Verse 3: Lennon]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
[Hook: Lennon]
Don't you know it's gonna be-e-e, all right
Do you know it's gonna be, all right
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right

[Verse 1: Ringo]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Verse 2: Ringo]
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?
[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3: Ringo]
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by

Rocky Raccoon Take 8,rock,the beatles,2018,1557,"[SPOKEN]

He was a fool unto himself

Rocky Raccoon
Rocky Raccoon
He was a fool unto himself
And he would not swallow his foolish pride
Mind you, coming from a little town in Minnesota
It was not the kind of thing that a young guy did
When a fellow went and stole his chick away from him

[SUNG]

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
Said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
The doctor walked in sminking of gin (laugh) [Sminking?]
And proceeded to lie on the table
He's really sminking of gin
And it did him in the end [Poor doc.]

Meantime back on the table, yeah
The doctor said, ""Rock, you met your match, son""
Rocky said, ""it's only a scratch, son
I'll be better soon""
""You better be, better soon,"" said the doc
Come on son, gotta get hip
Gotta get up
Gotta get back to your gun
Gotta go show that Danny Boy

However, Rocky Raccoon fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Da da da da...
That's the story of the Rocky Raccoon


[SPOKEN]
Now Rocky Racoon
Got up from his room and he walked out through the swing doors of the local saloon
Straight into the arms of someone new
Someone who he'd known from a long way back
Maybe from his primary school days
A young friend Rocky had recognized
[HALF-SPOKEN-HALF-SUNG]
He said, ""honey, will you be my new honey-bunch""
She said ""Rocky boy, come on, I'll show you why I love you.""
""Young Rocky Racoon, I love the way you wear your hat
Love the way you hid your pants, Rocky Raccoon, I dig you""

But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind[Verse 1]
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
[Verse 3]
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!

In case of accidents, he always took his mom

So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin

On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime

And donated to the National Trust

Rocky Raccoon 2018 Mix,rock,the beatles,2018,733,"[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I’m gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Hook]
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I’ll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

[Hook]
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Cry Baby Cry 2018 Mix,rock,the beatles,2018,407,"[Intro]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

[Verse 1]
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 3]
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 4]
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

[Verse 1]
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

[Chorus]

Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

[Chorus]

With the situation

They are standing still

The plan, the telegram

Ooh ooh

[Chorus]

Ooh

[Verse 4]
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

Alright!

[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is

[John] Okay?

[Verse 1]
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, ""You've got to go back""
You know they didn't even give us a chance

[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
[Verse 2]
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
""You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain""

[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, ""Say what you doing in bed?""
I said, ""We're only trying to get us some peace""

[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
""Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!""

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, ""She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag""

You know how hard it can be
The way things are going

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, ""We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back""

Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say

Paul: Yeah. Uh, do that one (Scatters and plays the piano to bass chords)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures
Joa, oa, oa, oan?""

But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head, do do do do do
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be
So, o, o, o""

But as she turns her back on the boy
He rose up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

So, o, o, o

A noise comes from the back

Made sure that he was dead

Old Brown Shoe Demo,rock,the beatles,1996,106,"[Verse 1]
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

[Chorus 2]
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
[Bridge]
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

But I just had to look
Having read the book

Dragged a comb across my head

And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds LOVE Version,rock,the beatles,2006,473,"[Instrumental Intro}

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

For well you know that it’s a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Getting Better 2017 Remix,rock,the beatles,2017,692,"[Intro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
It's getting better all the time

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon)]
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can’t complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You’re holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I’m doing the best that I can
[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I’ve got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can’t get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon)]
It’s getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

Maxwells Silver Hammer 2019 Mix,pop,the beatles,2019,641,"[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?""
But as she's getting ready to go, a knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times ""I must not be so, o, o, o""
But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head

P. C. 31 said, ""We caught a dirty one."", Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery, say he must go free

The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o

Within You Without You 2017 Remix,rock,the beatles,2017,468,"[Verse 1: George Harrison]
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

[Chorus 1]
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you

Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning

Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street
[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet The Wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They’d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go

The little children laugh at him behind his back

There beneath the blue suburban skies

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's fair
What a scene
Over men and horses, hoops and garters
Lastly through a hog’s head of real fire
In this way, Mr. K will challenge the world!

[Verse 2]
The celebrated Mr. K performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring
Don't be late
Messrs. K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course, Henry the Horse dances the waltz
[Instrumental]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate ten somersets he'll undertake
On solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight, Mr. Kite is topping the bill!

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

Rock and Roll Music Live at Nippon Budokan Hall Tokyo,rock,the beatles,1996,68,"[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 1]
I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a-wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

[Chorus]
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
Ain't in the mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for the congo
So keep a rockin' that piano

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Made my way upstairs and had a smoke
And everybody spoke and I went into a dream

""Oh shit""

And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Possessing and caressing me

They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Well get your lover and reel and rock it

Well early in the morning

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 1]
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane


[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

[Chorus]
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano


[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it

Penny Lane Anthology 2 Version,rock,the beatles,1996,158,"[Verse 1]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
[Piccolo trumpet solo]

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

There's an old Australian stockman, lying, dying...
Ahh...
And he gets himself up onto one elbow
And he turns to his four mates who are gathered 'round
And he says:

[Verse 1]
Cut your hair once a year, boys
Cut your hair once a year
If it covers your ear you can't hear, boys
So cut your hair once a year
All together now!
[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
(You must do that ""oooh!"" bit...)
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)

[Spoken bridge]
Ha, ha, ha! Dear, oh dear... I've forgetten the words now
Take care of me, make sure, look out after me...
Keep goin'...
(Laughter)
(Oooh!)

(Paul McCartney:) Take care, look after me, [inaudible]

I'll go again...

[Verse 2]
Don't ill treat me pet dingo, Ringo
Don't ill treat me pet dingo!
(Sung in a Liverpudlian accent:)They can't understand your lingo, Ringo...
So don't ill treat me pet dingo
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down
[Verse 3]
I think George's guitar's on the blink – I think
George's guitar's on the blink
It shouldn't go mm-nnga-mm-nnga, plink!
Hey, hey – that's really on the blink!
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

[Verse 4]
Prop me up by the wall, Paul
Prop me up by the wall
I'll scream and cheer 'til I fall, Paul
If you'll prop me up by the wall...
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
(That's where it should be – there: ""oooh!"")
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
[Verse 5]
Hey, keep the hits coming on John
Keep the hits coming on (oooh!)
At least 'til after I'm gone, John
Keep the hits coming on
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
(I got it!)
Tie me kangaroo down

Give us a bit of did-i-did-i-did-i...
That's it...

[Verse 6]
And with his very last gasp he says:
Tan me hide when death comes, chums
(Rolf coughs a few times) Oh dear...
Tan me hide when death comes
So we tanned his hide when he died, Clyde
And Ringo's got it on his drums!
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down!

All cameras four!
One, two three!

[Verse 1]
My baby said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Verse 2]
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said ""You've got the wrong location""
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909

Pick up my bag, run to the station
