Bohemian Rhapsody,rock,queen,1975,9247817,"[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

The Show Must Go On,rock,queen,1991,467247,"[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?

Without you, when you're gone

These Are the Days of Our Lives,rock,queen,1991,59973,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids
When we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know
The days were endless
We were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining
We just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

[Chorus]
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone
Now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
[Verse 2]
You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time
On a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking
On what you did
When you can lay back
And enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

[Chorus]
'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone
Now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change

The bad things in life were so few

Death on Two Legs Dedicated to...,rock,queen,1975,77413,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
(Ah!) You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'till it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

[Chorus]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own

Killjoy, bad guy
Big talkin' small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy
To replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good? Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide? (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
(Ah!) Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide

Dog with disease
You're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is
Mr. Know-All, was the fin on your back part of the deal?

Shark!

[Chorus]
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart (You never did)
Of your own (Right from the start)
Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride

When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh, so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you, oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink, my dear
To be honest, you haven't got a clue

I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck

I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree

The Prophets Song,rock,queen,1975,48189,"[Instrumental intro]

[Intro]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
""Listen to the warning,"" the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves

[Pre-Chorus]
""I see no day,"" I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
""Listen to the warning,"" the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand
Oh-oh, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove
[Verse 2]
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain

[Pre-Chorus]
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
""Listen to the warning,"" the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
And two by two, my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you
[Acapella Canon]
Ah, people can you hear me?
And now I know and now I know
And now I know, I know
I know that you can hear me
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake, in two will break
The earth will shake, in two will break
Death all around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Now I know, now I know, now I know
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know

You songs full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be a Valentino, just for you

Takin’ off

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, ""Be a superstar""
But I tell you, just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Yeah), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money, honey, you'll survive

Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

Don't listen to what Mama says
Not a word, not a word Mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival (sure)

Knelt sinners by his side
And said ""You're going to realize tomorrow""

And baby lambs where Samson dares

To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land

Colouring, holding the world inside

Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies
To find a new destination
That is the sign

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

[Verse 2]
He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
The palm of a hand the incredible size
One great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
""Ooh, keep a lookout!""
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry

Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Why don't you mean it
Why do I follow you
And where do you go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
You've never seen nothing
Like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
(And the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing
In a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys
Praying in the dead of night
[Chorus]
Here comes the Black Queen
Poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that
Bring them down to size
(March to the Black Queen)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little bit of sugar
Then a rub-a dub-a baby oil

[Chorus]
Black on, black on
Every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that
Keep making all that noise
(Oooh, march to the Black Queen)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-chile, yes
[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
(A little bit of love and joy)
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
(A little bit of love and joy)
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

[Verse 4]
I reign with my left hand
I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness
I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me
I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Ah, ah, ah, ah
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes
And she never dots her i's
(She's our leader)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
(La la la la forever) forever

Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

Baby you've been had

39,rock,queen,1975,104039,"[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
In the year of '39
Assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darlin', we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Seaside, whenever you stroll along with me
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile, I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could, but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle, highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

[Verse 2]
I feel so romantic, can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (Ooh, I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season
The Mediterranean
This time of year, it's so fashionable

I feel like dancing in the rain
Can I have a volunteer?
(Just keep right on dancing)
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification, as a matter of fact
So très charmant, my dear

[Verse 4]
Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night
Meantime (And in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial, start a sensational

Good Company,rock,queen,1975,22578,"[Verse 1]

Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company

Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Won't you keep me company?

Oh, marry me for evermore

My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door

My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company

I hardly noticed Sally
As we parted company

All through the years
In the end, it appears
There was never really anyone but me

Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity

[Verse 1]
Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me (I want it)
Take a little love from me
I wanna share it with you
I feel like a millionaire

Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days
Holding hands together
Do you remember, my love?
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
How we wish that we could stay there
Forever and ever

Now I am sad, you are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me
How I long for your love
Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be

And a lantern goes swinging by

Waiting for the moonlight

Foresee the future years

Don't know

Drowse,rock,queen,1976,15118,"[Verse 1]
It's the sad-eyed goodbye
Yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street
Weak-kneed partings I recall

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the mistier mist, the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays

[Chorus]
There's all the more reason
For laughing and crying
When you're younger
And life isn't too hard at all

[Verse 2]
It's the fantastic drowse
Of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings
To waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a vertical hold
All the things that you're told
For the everyday hero
It all turns to zero

[Chorus]
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying
When you're young
And your troubles are all very small

[Bridge]
Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds more
In the pool hall than we did
In the school hall
With the downtown
Chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife
The lights and the fun
[Verse 3]
Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy
It ain’t easy at all

[Outro]
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached
For breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like?

Through every precious day

Spread Your Wings,rock,queen,1978,40957,"[Verse 1]
Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
""Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping
Up the Emerald Bar""

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

Alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world
Nothing would make him stay

[Verse 2]
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
""This could be my last chance""
His boss said to him
""Now listen, boy! You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition
You won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy
At the Emerald Bar?""

[Chorus]
So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

Sleeping on the Sidewalk,rock,queen,1977,10456,"[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain’t nobody wants to know

[Chorus]
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

[Verse 2]
So 'round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Hey, sonny, won't you sign
Right along the dotted line?
What you sayin', are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?
[Chorus]
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home
Now, I'll tell you what happened

[Bridge]
They took me to a room without a table
They said ""blow your trumpet into here""
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

[Verse 3]
I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people wanna listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

[Chorus]
And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
Have to have some fun
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Now they tell me
That I ain’t so fashion-able
And that I owe the man
A million bucks a year
So I told 'em
Where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here, yeah
Back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry
And I sure do wanna go home

Who Needs You,rock,queen,1977,13158,"[Verse 1]

Always try to keep me hanging round
You little spoilt thing
Girl, you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view

This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding
Lying flat on your face
Reaching out reaching out
For a helping hand
(Where is that helping hand?)

Oh, muchachos
I like it, I like it
Well, I don't need you

How I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward
Slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling
That you can't forget
Reaching out for a helping hand

When I met you
You were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were, oh, so, so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say

So naïve you took me for a ride

You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down

Did I live my life right?

Oh, to fall in love
Was my very first mistake

I was far too much in love to see?

You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise

You couldn't lose, you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

With matters of the heart?

To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me

You bring me sorrow, you cause me pain

Turned me into a jealous kind

If You Cant Beat Them,rock,queen,1978,7466,"[Verse 1]
Keep your chin up
When you're feeling lonely
Don't let 'em get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting
All alone, hanging around
For someone to call, oo-oo-ooh
They won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said, ""give as good as you get""
Yeah!

You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good

Come on, go
Get up!
Hey-hey!
It sure feels good

Keep your big hands off of my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine
And dine me, trying to wind
Me 'round and around and bind me
To your legal contract (Ha ha!)
Rumour has it that you can play it dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do
About that, that yeah!
I'll play you at your own game!

And I slam the door and I'm on my way

I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games

I'm all tired of tears

Shaking dust from my shoes

And there's no way
Back home (no way back home)
Oh, but I have to say

Oh, there's a million things
A-calling me back

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours

How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

Pain Is So Close to Pleasure,rock,queen,1986,6322,"[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Everybody knows
One day we're loving each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time

[Verse 1]
When I was young
And just getting started
And people talked to me
They sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my 'magination
And all I wanted
Was to start a new relation
So in love, but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for
Some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed
Was some love and affection
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong
And you turn out the light
But inside of your mind
You put up a fight

[Verse 2]
Where are the answers
That we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world
To be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good
Some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love
Wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse
So let's make the best
Of the rest of our years
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure

It's a machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for rock 'n' roll
They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man

They freeze me, they burn me
They squeeze me, they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons
Of steel they compress me
But no one, but no one
But no one can wrest me away

We have no disease
No troubles of mind
We are fighting for peace
No regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception
Of love or defeat

It's bytes and mega chips for tea
It's that Machine, boys
With random access memory
Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold, yeah

Friends Will Be Friends,rock,queen,1986,37817,"[Intro]

Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped
And the children are created
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash
And leaving you with the lumber

Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
'Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end

The postman delivered
A letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You try to track him down
But somebody stole his number

Without him in your way

Cause love is all you need

To be alone in this world
When you're down and out
On your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming
In the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing
Everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down
And you're flat on your back
A brand new day's beginning
Get that sunny feeling
And you're on your way

Without a job and no money
To spend, you're a stranger

You're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger, yeah

Just keeps burning deep inside

It's gonna be the end

Who needs some loving care

Waiting for life to go by

Let's go, let's go, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I took my baby dancing
To see a heavy band
But never saw my baby till the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool
Didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel
Did you have to run off with that dog-gone fool?

[Chorus]
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't mind the postman
If the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man, electric man, a man who'll fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock and roll clone
And leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?
Go ahead, fool

All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy

Like you've been hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching, rolling on the floor
Next time you're on the TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoiled brat
To think that I nearly let you get away with all that
No way, baby

All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you

Everybody drank my wine

Meets a white hot lady

Better hold on tight

Every drop of rain that falls
In Sahara Desert says it all
It's a miracle
All God's creations great and small
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal
That's a miracle
Test tube babies being born
Mothers, fathers dead and gone
It's a miracle

[Chorus 1]
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
The wonders of this world go on
The hanging Gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

The one thing we're all waiting for
Is peace on earth, an end to war
It's a miracle we need, the miracle
The miracle we're all waiting for today

If every leaf on every tree
Could tell a story that would be
A miracle
If every child on every street
Had clothes to wear and food to eat
That's a miracle
If all God's people could be free
To live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle

[Chorus 2]
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
(The wonders of this world go on)
Open hearts and surgery
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting
Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling

Set in my sights?
Am I a happy man
Or is this sinking sand?

I blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit
Thought we were perfect

Put down our money
Without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won
If we lost

Action This Day,rock,queen,1982,6457,"[Intro]
Action

[Verse 1]
This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

[Refrain]
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me

[Verse 2]
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let-down
Coming to this town honey is a showdown

[Refrain]
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still, there's a feeling, this world is using me
[Chorus]
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, we've gotta learn to learn to love to live
You can't say it ain't right

Oh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right

[Verse 3]
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind's living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race

[Refrain]
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me

Put Out the Fire,rock,queen,1982,6270,"[Verse 1]
They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand, boy
He disappointed me
So I got my handgun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
I had to make him pay

[Pre-Chorus]
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out, baby, it's the season
For the mad masquerade

Put out the fire

Oh, you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Don't believe what your granddaddy said
[Verse 2]
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution
Is right on my side
'Cause I caught my lover
In my neighbor's bed
I got retribution
Filled 'em all full of lead

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame

[Chorus]
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire, baby
Put out the fire
And let your sons and your daughters sleep sound in their beds

You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns

Life Is Real Song for Lennon,rock,queen,1982,15182,"[Verse 1]
Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past

Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real

Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel

Life is real, life is real
Life is real, oh yeah

Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it

Life is real, life is real

Loving like a whore

We Believe,rock,queen,2008,718,"[Verse 1]
I believe there is no evil out there we did not have a hand in
You believe it is a time for peace and a time for understanding
Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side we will win the game
And some of us believe that there is a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let us get it straight

I believe there is just once chance in this world to hear our brothers
You believe there is a better way to listen to each other
We do not get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we do not understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down

[Chorus]
We believe there is a better way to fight
There is a way to make our children safe at night
We believe there is a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive
[Verse 2]
I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows
You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill
A man or a woman who knows how to say I am sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes
Match the intent with the deed

[Chorus]
We believe there is a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation - in our time
We believe there is not a minute we should be wasting
When the darkness falls it is too late to fix the crime
It is peace that we need

[Verse 3]
Every father every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get

[Chorus]
We believe there is a song that is worth the singing
It is a song of truth we are bringing
There is a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun

Cosmos Rockin,rock,queen,2008,595,"[Intro]
What planet is this, mmmh?
Let there be rock and roll

[Verse 1]
It is a Saturday night and I am home alone
With the music on quiet I am flying solo
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat
Put the music up loud hear it in the street
Then the neighbours start banging on my front door
Throw the door wide open saying what is your point
Come on in let us rock this joint

[Chorus]
We got the whole house rocking[x5]
To the mighty power of rock and roll

[Verse 2]
We dance out of the door, dance into the street
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat
We rock down the road and down to the town
And all the people stare and smile and get down
Then the police man is saying ""stop this noise""
But the beat takes over now he is one of the boys
The beat's taken over now he is one of the boys
Come on down let us rock this town
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let us go
Let it roll
Are you ready?
Said are you ready?
The Cosmos Rocks

[Verse 3]
Across seven seas through the Panama
Now they are rocking on beaches and they are rocking in bars
Do not ask me how and do not ask me why
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi
There is a rock and roll fever in every place
Next thing you know they'll be rocking out in space


[Chorus]
Come on down let us rock this place
Come on down and
Sock it to me

We got the whole world rocking[x5]
To the mighty mighty mighty power
We got the cosmos rocking[x2]

Time to Shine,rock,queen,2008,1554,"[Verse 1]

To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the round your head in the clouds
And you are wondering if you are never coming down
In an instant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here is to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance too

Unveiling the secrets of song to be sung
Waters of life flowing soft to the touch
Wisdom remembered have we forgotten oh so much

Still Burnin,rock,queen,2008,438,"[Verse 1]
I cannot wake in the morning
I cannot sleep at night
I got a pain in my memory
That just will not sit right
You might say I am losing my mind
What a shame, shame, shame
But I do not want and I do not need
To play the crying game
Music lights this flame in me
I will not let it go and it will not let me be
I am just a happy slave and oh I cannot leave it
Because I am still, and I always will - be a believer

Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning (and the wheel's)
Still turning (ooh let me tell you why)

Still driven (and we are all)

I cannot breathe in the city
Got dust in my lungs
I get mad in the country
Everything seem to go wrong
You might think I am playing around
But my heart is true
I got reason to believe
That sweet soul magic
Going to tear my heart in two
Music makes the world go round
I have been flying on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I am still a believer
Heading for the stars

Oh yeah
Still burning, still yearning
Still burning
Still yearning
Still turning (better than every guy)
We are jiving
Still driving
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)

But do not think for a moment that my heart went cold
I keep thinking about what I lost
And what I might have found

Everything had turned around

I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair

But I travelled a long road

You're really petrified
Lover turns to hater on this escalator

Reaching and doping we will find the right one

Magic cocktails for lives

Take a peace of my heart
Ooh ooh, take a piece of my soul
(Ooh, ooh) Let me live
Oh yeah

Why don't you take
Another little piece of my heart?
Why don't you take it
And break it and tear it all apart?
All I do is give and all you do is take
Baby, why don't you
Give me a brand new start?

Why don't you shape it
And shake it 'til you're really in control?
All you do is take, all I do is give
All that I'm askin' is a chance to live

But you can always depend on me
And if you're (ever in trouble) hey!
You know where I will be

[Verse 4] (Brian May)
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my life?
Why don't you twist it
And turn it and cut it like a knife?
All you do is live, all I do is die
Why can't we just
Be friends, stop livin' a lie?

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life
Is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman
Gives me sweet mother love ah ha

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world
And they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy
And my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity
Just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside
[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me
All the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're going to give me all your sweet
Mother love ah ha (mother love)

My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet

Too Much Love Will Kill You,rock,queen,1992,58214,"[Verse 1]
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home and I've been facing this alone
For much too long
Oh, I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you if you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster, 'cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
Ooh, how would it be if you were standing in my shoes?
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
[Bridge]
Oh, yes!

[Chorus]
Too much love will kill you, just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you, make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy, you're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time

And raise our glasses one more time

And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye...

Hijack My Heart,rock,queen,1989,2849,"Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts
Nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my surprise
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights what do I see
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat out of hell
I get to eat her dust
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh
I'd never known anything that counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steals my heart

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart

Look at the cities
Look at the streets what do you see
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be
Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you know you won't let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Oooee baby what's become of me

Let Me in Your Heart Again,pop,queen,2014,5530,"[Intro]
Uh, ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When people talk of love
I'll lead the conversation
I'll say I feel just fine
Happy with my situation
But when I look away, huh
People know my mind is straying
To where I once belonged
Dreaming about your heart again

[Chorus 1]
(Your heart again) Yeah
Your heart again
Let me in your heart again
Listen to me honey

[Verse 2]
When you have to face the blues
I give you satisfaction
(It's your heart again)
Despair was on your mind
I gave you the right direction
(It's your heart again)
So don't you walk away
Remember it's my heart you're breaking
You forget we were in love
Now my heart is only filled with pain
[Chorus 2]
(Your heart again) Oh
(Your heart again) Heart again
Let me in your heart again

[Bridge]
Oh, my love
I want you to stay
Don't leave me now
Or I'll just fade away
Oh, my love, don't hurt me this way

[Guitar Solo]
Oh, forgive me, babe
Do not ever tell me goodbye
Ooh
Tell me yes
Oh
Don't make me wait too long
Or I'll lose my mind

When people talk of love
I have no hesitation
(It's your heart again)
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I'll hold that conversation for you, baby

When the piper is gone and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies, to find a new destination
That is the sign
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

With a mighty tongue he catches flies
Palm of a hand, incredible size
Great big eye, has a focus in your direction
And the battle is won
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

You can't see in, but you can't see out

Two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

And then the great big fight is over

At anytime an invitation, you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious, precise

Everybody at home? Yeah?

Come on, come on

I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, ""Be a superstar""
Tell you, ""Just be satisfied, stay right where you are""

Keep yourself alive

All you people keep yourself alive
Come on, rrrah!
Let me see it
Ow!

Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need, feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
Told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, rode a million miles
Still be where I started, same as when I started

The seven seas of Rhye

Mister— Do and I'll die

Storm the master-marathon
I’ll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire and I'll survive (I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature, come out alive
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you— you shod and, shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours

I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye

Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
High, Higher, High

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why?
Why?
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure

And everything I had to know

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars

You made us feel like we could fly (radio)

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

On videos for hours and hours

Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way

But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

Ahhh
Ahhh

In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever (Ooh, yeah)
Lions' den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever (and on and on and on)
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on

Ooh yeah (Too soon)

He can do right and nothing wrong, wrong

Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain

Sea turns dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes

Broken my fairy circle ring

Saints you leave far behind

Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realize tomorrow
No, I'm not going to tell you
What you already know

Come, come on the time is right

Had to make do with the worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired, need a rest

Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya, grab ya hard
Make you feel ten feet tall

Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperatures down
And the jukebox blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin'
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use

My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars

You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

On videos for hours and hours

Here we stand or here we fall

Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won’t be home tonight

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all, yeah
And it’s time for the hammer to fall

Every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build up...

Tow your line and play their game
'Til the anesthetic covers it all
'Til one day they call your name
Then it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same (Oh no, oh no)
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, now your struggle's all in vain, oh, yeah

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Just wanna  scream it louder and louder and louder

Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
Then it’s time for the hammer to, hammer to fall

Still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

She keeps Moet et Chandon, in her pretty cabinet
""Let them eat cake,"" she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (A killer, a killer)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined (She's a killer queen)
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise

Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action

Bohemian Rhapsody 2011 Remaster,rock,queen,2018,22427,"[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Outro]
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Action
Hey!

[Verse 1]
This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

[Refrain]
You got a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me

[Verse 2]
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let-down
Coming to this town honey is a showdown

[Refrain]
You got a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
I gotta feeling that just won’t quit, this world is using me
[Chorus]
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, you’ve got the power to know, to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to know and to live
You can't say it ain't right

[Verse 3]
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind honey, in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race

[Refrain]
You got a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me

[Chorus]
Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Ooh, you’ve got the power to know and to live
You can't say it ain't right

It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you
How I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can’t face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I am naked and I am far from home

[Verse 2]
The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body’s aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo. (Galileo) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right
Got my act all tight

And your daddy said he won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm going to lose out this time
Hey!

Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around

Go get out of my house
That's all I ever get from you
And your family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From you guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm going to make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Shouting and fighting all night

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Send your brother swimming with a brick
That's alright
Tie your mother down

She ain’t ain't no friend of mine!

And kicked me out on my own

[Intro]
Oooh yeah

[Verse 1]
Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right
I got my act all tight
It's got to be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
No way I'm going to lose out this time

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
[Verse 2]
You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house
That's all I ever get from you
Ain't your family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm going to make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Send your brother swimming with a brick
That's alright
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
She ain't no friend of mine
She ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
Your momma and your daddy going to
Plague me until I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace loving guy

Get that big, big, big, big, big, big
Daddy out the door
Tie your mother down

Under Pressure Live at Wembley Stadium 1986,rock,queen,1992,1316,"[Audience Cheering & Clapping]

[Intro]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Um ba ba be
Da ba be
De day da
Ee day da
That's okay
[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""Let me out!""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay

[Verse 2]
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""Let me out""
Pray tomorrow gets me high, higher
[Bridge]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why?
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of

Hey, hey
You know what song
Get in the groove, babe

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, sing it!

One more!

And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Hey, hey, hey

Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead

But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body’s aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We are just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays

Tow the line and play their game
Let the anesthetic cover it all
Until one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

Your truth is all the same (oh no, oh no)
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no)
Baby now your struggle's all in vain

In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars

You made us feel like we could fly (radio)

A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

White Queen As It Began Live at the Rainbow London / March 1974,rock,queen,2014,216,"So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known:
The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing, unheard
Pleading, one word
So sad, her eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath the window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no words could make
Still, I wait
(guitar and piano solos)

My goddess hear, my darkest fear
It's not too late
It's forevermore that I wait

Dear friend, goodbye
No tears, (in) my eyes
So sad, it ends
As it began

Hit it
You bugger you

Now listen, all you people
Throw out the good and keep the bad
Very soon you're gonna be in the bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
And very soon you're gonna be a disciple
Don't listen to what your mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival, sure
The great Lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
Said 'you're going to realize tomorrow'

No, I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on, come on the time is right
This evil man will fight

See the feller crack-a-nut
At night's noon-time
Axe he swears
'cause he climbs he dare
To deliver

Ploughman 'Waggoner Will' and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
Dally-oh
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
What a dirty lad-io

Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
Hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend...
In yellow
What a quaere fellow...

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy

And there's a good apothecary man

Ah, ah, ah, Huh, Haaah!
Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to
Find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to ogre battle fight

He gives a great big cry
Swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue, he catches flies
The palm of a hand incredible size
Great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
And the battle is won
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to ogre battle fight
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Haaah!
Hit it ...

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta stay clear and out of sight
You can't see in but you can see out
Keep a GOOD lookout ...

The ogre men are coming out
Two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go sout
(guitar solo)

Ogre men are comin' home
And then the great big fight is over
Bugle blow let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives forevermore

Yes you can come along
You can come along

So sad, her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad, her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon stir this way
In sorrow known

The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad her eyes
She cannot see
How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath the window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no words can make
Still, I wait

My Goddess hear, my darkest fear:
I speak too late
It's for Evermore that I wait

Dear friends, goodbye
No tears (in) my eyes
So sad, it ends
As it began ...

Flick of the Wrist Live at the Rainbow London / November 1974,rock,queen,2014,295,"Brian: It's called 'Flick Of The Wrist', thank you

Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double, double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise ...

Don't look back;
Don't look back

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
Dig in the ribs, and then a kick in the head
Taken an arm, taken a leg...
All this time honey
Baby, you've been had

Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
""Prostitute yourself"", he says
Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you 'til you've dried
Don't look back;
Don't look back:
It's a rip off

(instrumental/guitar & piano solo)

Work my fingers to my bones
Scream with pain
Still make no impression

Seduce you with his money-make- machine
Cross-collateralize
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine
And then the last goodbye, bye, bye, bye

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
Dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
Taken an arm, taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby, you've been had

There’s a rumor going  'round, gotta clear outta town

Here come the law, gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never, I never get it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Watch-a
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
With my rubber- tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me

They're gonna put me in a cell, if you can't go to heaven
Would you let me go to hell

Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired
Don't you know
Well, you know what I mean?

Fifty-eight that was great
But it's over now and that's all

Something harder's coming up
Gonna knock a hole in the wall

Gonna grab you hit you hard
Gonna make you ten feet tall

Well I hope that a brand new baby's
Gonna come along soon
And you know it could happen
Any old rainy afternoon
When the temperature's down
And the jukebox blowing a fuse
And my temperature ride
Just like a Sunday-school cruise

And you know everybody in this world could use
Modern times! - rock 'n' roll
Modern times! - rock 'n' roll

Get your high heeled guitar styled boots
And some groovy clothes
Get a hairpiece on your chest
A ring through your nose

Find a nice little man
Who's gonna make you big, big star
Stars in your eyes, ants in your pants
You gotta go far

And you know everybody
In this bum sucking world should go far

Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known

Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came

And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My Goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day

But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

Keep you satisfied

And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul

Ooh yeah (Too soon)
My fairy king
(He guides the winds)
He can do right and nothing wrong

Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain

Sea turns dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes
(No more)

Broken my fairy circle ring

I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you to be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive (yeah)
Keep yourself alive (ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
But honey you'll survive

Well I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don’t listen to what mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you’ll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realize tomorrow
No, I’m not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you once before

My lady soon will stir this way

Stars of lovingness in her hair

Spread Your Wings BBC Session/October 28th 1977 Maida Vale 4 Studio,rock,queen,2016,118,"[Verse 1]
Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, ""Boy, you’d better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar""

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better
That’s because you're a free man

[Bridge]
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay
[Verse 2]
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
""This could be my last chance""
His boss said to him, ""Now listen, boy! You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can’t you be happy at the Emerald Bar?""

[Chorus]
So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away

You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside that's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now the feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying, I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Verse 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving and I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through
[Chorus]
(It's late) But it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know, but don't try to tell me that it's
(Too late) Save our love, you can't turn out the lights
(So late) I've been wrong, but I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

I've been so long, you've been so long
We've been so long trying to work it out
I ain't got long, you ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

[Guitar Solo]
Tell me
Try to work it out, yeah
Ooh!
Ooh, too late
Yeah
Too late, much too late
Ah!

[Verse 3]
You're staring at me with suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight, is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

(It's late) Ooh, but it's time to set me free
(It's late) Ooh yes, I know, but there's no way it has to be

Another party's over
And I’m left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't want to talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew

[Bridge]
So come and get me, let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low
So don't expect me to behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I’m in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon

I'm causing a mild sensation with this new occupation
I'm permanently glued to this extraordinary mood
So now move over and let me take over
With my melancholy blues

I'm in the news
I’m just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure

Give it to me

Pressing down on you, no man ask for

Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Watching some good friends screaming, ""Let me out!""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor

Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn

Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night

Caring about ourselves

(Audience cheering)
This  is ""Under Pressure""
Mmm  da de
Dum bum ba be
Duh doom duh duh do ba

[Verse 1]
Pressure  pushing down on me
Pressing  down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits  a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge]
Um ba ba be

Ee  day da
De day da
That's okay!
[Chorus]
It’s the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""Let me out!""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets
Day day day
De de de de day
Okay

[Verse 2]
Chippin' around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days, it never rains but it pours
Dee do da de

Sat on a fence but it don’t work
Keep comin' up with love but it's so slashed and torn

Why can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?

And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of

Is This the World We Created... ? Live in Budapest 1986,rock,queen,2012,94,"[Intro]
Howl at the moon

[Verse 1]
Just think of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded?
Against our own
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

[Verse 2]
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man, sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Ohh!
[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated?
Right to the bone

Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars

A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care

Friends Will Be Friends Live in Budapest 1986,rock,queen,2012,111,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Another red letter day
So  the pound has dropped and the children are created
The  other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors  on strike, what you need is a rest
It's  so easy, love, 'cause you've got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When  you're in need of love, they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Friends  will be friends
Right till the end

It's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way
It's so easy now, 'cause you got friends you can trust

Time after time
I've done my sentence

And I ain't gonna lose

But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, ""Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar""

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away

Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
""This could be my last chance""

You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?""

Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

Radio Ga Ga Live at Rock in Rio Festival,rock,queen,2020,88,"[Intro]
(Radio)

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
(Radio)

[Verse 2]
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
Had your time, had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)
Everybody
[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 3]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years (Radio)
Hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
Had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry

A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead

But now I've gone and thrown it all away

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I hеard it on my radio

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you
In the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
Turning my mind away
Oh oh, how I could love you
But, I don't know the way
Oh, but you should love me
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now
The feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying
I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late
[Verse 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now, you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though, I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

[Chorus]
(It's late) Oh, and it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know
But don't try to tell me that it's
(Too late) Save our love
You can't turn out the lights
(So late) I've been wrong
But I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
C'mon
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

[Chorus]
(It's late) Yes it's late, but it's time to set me free
(It's late) Ooh yes, I know
But there's no way it has to be
(Too late) So let the fire
Take our bodies this night

Take our guilt in the tide, now

Berchie,rap,queen,2021,63,"You’re mine

Somehow I always just take you back in
Hate when we fight but we here to the end
Make me think about the very first time
When we exchanged notes and layed up all night
Crazy that I’d thought I never know
That I’d find love in this generation of empty souls
Swear I thought I would never even come see this far
Cuz feelings sometimes will make me feel like Im dead and gone
But all that changеd when I met you
Knew at first glacе something was true
You was there chilling with your friends
Swear you looked so effortless
Dont Know if I walk up or ignore ya baby
You was glowin Like the moon
I was nervous I’d fall through was wrong baby
From ya demeanor It looked like I came on you too strong
You flash smile and then ask of my name and where Im from
Then you look me up and and down to see what time Im on
Whether I am just a typical
Or if sing a different song
Cuz you know that nobody perfect
Busy searching for something thats real
You don’t know in my my mind that your worth it baby
That is why I already feel

Chorus

I have never felt so strong about somebody
You are everything I need and more
Like a drug I can’t get you right out my body
When Im diving in deep your core

You my shawty, my boo thang forever baby
Imma show you off all to the world
When I look in your eyes I see heaven baby
You’re my Queen til the end do us part


You’re my queen til the end do us part

You’re mine

Verse 2

Lovely
Can I get your number
Can I just get something bout ya for me to remember
Promise I won’t waste ya time like other dudes do you love
Don’t know how it worked
But somehow we just started talking over the phone and then all of a sudden
One text turned to two then turn to FaceTiming from night til dawn
Moved from hanging out to when the first date will be on
First date turned to second then to many years just to ask
Will you be Vanessa and to you I’ll be Gigi’s Dad
You on my mind for 24 hours and 7 days
I spend 8 of them thinking how I can make you say
Oh baby, I love you
And always know that I love you too
Chorus

I have never felt so strong about somebody
You are everything I need and more
Like a drug I can’t get you right out my body
When Im diving in deep your core

You my shawty, my boo thang forever baby
Imma show you off all to the world
When I look in your  eyes I see heaven baby

Magic

One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
(It's no good)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day

The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done

This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn (ahhh) of sanity
