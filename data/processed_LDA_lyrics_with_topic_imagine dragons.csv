I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

We're painted red to fit right in

[Verse 1]
In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye
But I've never wondered why

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly
So I've never had to lie

Its Time,rock,imagine dragons,2010,327679,"[Verse 1]
So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna leave this town

Demons,rock,imagine dragons,2012,1309887,"[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go

Better tell them while they're here 'cause

I've had the deepest rivers

You've got a history list, and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor, and the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
[Pre-Chorus]
I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away!

And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns grey

Give me strength to press on

From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise

For all the ones who gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close
Like you wanted me to
Believe in you

With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all

An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades

Off in the distance, there is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey Mr. Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery
How come I've never seen your face around here?
I know every single face around here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here

We'd rather die than do it your way

Back in the casing, shaking and pacing
This is the tunnel's light
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
Look through the rifle's sight

Hearing the heckle, holding the shackle
I was never welcome here

Picking up clocks
When the birds come back to eat

Up on the mountain
Down in the king's lair
Pushing these blocks
In the heat of the afternoon
Oh, afternoon

Down in the cellar

But that never meant a thing
Running from the country

No need to hurry
Those streets are slick at night

Screaming out in agony

""The things you say are never right""
""The sins of all the world lie on your head""

Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind

Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time

There's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on

[Verse 1]
It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh, the jury stole my fame

[Pre-Chorus]
And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me
[Chorus]
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight

[Verse 2]
Oh, you look so alive
D-d-d-did you think that we'd cry tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd cry?
Oh, can you feel my heart?
I think I feel it, too
D-d-d-did you think that we'd die tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd die?

And it shined into these eyes

Flies into the places where the silence screams
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams, oh

Arrange, we can assess, we can attain
We are the entry for entities to entice and entertain

Asking why I'm here instead of home
Now I stand alone

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done

[Verse 1]
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here
But I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

[Refrain]
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
[Verse 2]
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishin' I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong

[Refrain]
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away

Take me away, take me away

Fall to the ground without a sound

I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear, dream maker, life taker

Off for all your deeds

Waste of precious breath (no time)

I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen

It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

I don't ever wanna let you down
So this is what you meant

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was

This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but

I've traveled all this way for something

Blank Space/Stand By Me Live From Spotify London,pop,imagine dragons,2015,15046,"[Verse 1 (Blank Space)]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Eh, eh

[Verse 2 (Blank Space)]
New money, suit and tie
I could read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
Dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make a bad guy good for a weekend

[Chorus (Blank Space)]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause, you know, I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
[Verse 3 (Blank Space)]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4 (Blank Space)]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she? ""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darlin', I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus (Blank Space)]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause, you know, I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby...
[Verse 3 (Stand By Me)]
When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus (Stand By Me)]
So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me
Stand by me

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far

I Bet My Life Riot Games Remix,pop,imagine dragons,2015,614,"[Verse 1]
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you
[Verse 2]
I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies, but
Now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do

[Pre-Chorus]
Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you

[Bridge]
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done
[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you

The Pit,rock,imagine dragons,2008,3831,"[Intro]
I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes

[Verse 1]
Sitting here all by ourselves, counting all the people
As they pass us by
They gather all around and stare on down into a dark, dark pit
Don't go, please don't go
But they step on in, oh, they fall all in, they walk all over you
'Cause one step at a time, they all walk in a line
Down a false, false hope

[Chorus]
I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we'd hear
[Post-Chorus]
If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand

[Bridge]
Oh, how can I, how can I convince you to stay?
Where all the flowers bloom, the grass, it sways
And the rain, it pours, and the waves all roar
And the trees they grow
And the fallen crow soars down into that dark cold pit
And you follow it in
Oh, you follow it in

[Chorus]
Well, I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we'd hear

Draw a rumor; flashing lights and let all whispers die
Sixteen colors, I'm so lonely

And everybody says things rationally

Suppressed emotions flying past
Are heading out the other end
The precious love, the daily grind
It's wonderful
Elastic wasted, rubber ghost
Are floating past the midnight hour
They push aside the things that matter most

Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Lord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't really care and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenities, I'm gettin' better with time

Whatever It Takes,rock,imagine dragons,2017,1269256,"[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip

Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Yeah, take me to the top

Living Musical,rock,imagine dragons,2008,2901,"[Verse 1]
It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about, a sudden attraction
Between two with a few of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds, but it flies to the bottom
Baby I'm blessed to be here
Blessed to just bask in your presence, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

[Chorus]
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you
[Post-Chorus]
Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, oh
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

[Verse 2]
She was coughing on the coolers as she asked for my number
I was living in a dream, feelings roll down like thunder
I never met my match, melodic melodies mumble
A cocky young thing meets a girl and I stumble
For the first time in my life I don't know where to start
With a brush in my hand I don't know when it's art
When I laugh she must smile, when I smile she must laugh
Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path?

And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, I wanna let loose

And wanna leave my own life behind

Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

Writing my poems for the few

Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Whatever It Takes Live/Acoustic,rock,imagine dragons,2017,1552,"[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
I do whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
I do whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
Yet a masterpiece, yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave my body and my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
I do whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)

Radioactive Live at the Grammy Awards 2014,rap,imagine dragons,2014,2742,"[Intro: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathin' in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up, checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
YA! YA! YA! YA!

[Hook]
""Man down, where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan
YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all, duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
Lets get It!
[Hook]
""Man down, where you from, nigga?""
""I said, where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I say—
YA! YA! YA! YA!

[Hook: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
[YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!]
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Bridge: Dan Reynolds+Kendrick Lamar]
All systems go
[Systems go]
The sun it hasn't died
[Hasn't died]
Deep in my bones
[In my bones]
Straight from inside
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]

Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, when they start their Martial Law
When these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Lord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't really care and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, energy go to the almighty God
Drown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenities
I'm gettin' better with time
Aaah!

[Hook: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time, can you
Hey
Can you feel me with time
Oh
Can you feel me with time, can you
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time

I'm just taking my time to stand in line
For a dance with you, whoa, dance with you, whoa oh
It may not appear, but it's been fully clear
That I'm standing here, fully pleading, near bleeding
Dying, for a chance with you, oh, whoa

[Chorus]
Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

If you stand with my heart in hand
Oh, perfect and, perfect and, perfect and
So unaware of my longing stare
If all I care is to dance with you

I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I could stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

My thoughts are cut, I close my eyes shut
Knowing it's not you, but there's a chance it's you
For a dance with me, oh, whoa, yeah, whoa-oh-oh

I Love You All The Time,pop,imagine dragons,2015,7947,"[Verse 1]
I'm never alone, I look at my phone
If I call you up, you're never at home
I love you all the time
I'm fueled up and high, a man among guys
A smile on my face, no reason to cry
I love you all the time

[Chorus]
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I can tell you're gonna take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

Ce soir c'est le soir et toi avec moi
Et tu viens me voir, très bien ouh la la

Whatever It Takes Jorgen Odegard Remix,pop,imagine dragons,2017,2147,"[Intro]
I do what it takes

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
[Chorus]
Whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes (oh)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh)
('Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins)
I do what it takes
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
[Chorus]
Whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins (oh)
I do whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes (oh)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh)
('Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins)
I do what it takes
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me

Bottle of Coke Demo,rock,imagine dragons,2008,2140,"[Verse 1]
Always take it slow, I'm just a little too bold
I'm growing older than my age
I can't believe, I can't believe that
You've been on my mind
Oh, call it like you see it, I'm a little too early
Let it be, I'm just a puddle of mud
Staining everything I see
That walks all over me

Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

Wise men say I'm foolish, I just give 'em all a grin
The wise are prudent, never walking on a limb
I live on stars that burn so bright they close their eyes
Typically I'm weak when I'm a little bit nervous
Oh, you think I'm such a competent fool
I'm telling everyone I know I'm strolling streets

Curtain Call Demo,rock,imagine dragons,2008,2612,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
It's a, a strange thing
Just a miracle dream
To be at peace with a fling
What if I'm more than crushes?
And moved past more than just lust
To feel it deep inside
Crying out to my trust
It's indescribably pushin' it
My mind is uncertainty
Beside I want a love that's all certain
Beyond a doubt I want to shout it out
I will shout it out to the world
To find a woman with certainty
Being my whole life earnin'
But, my baby, what's burnin'?
Discernin' it comes from the heart
That the mind of the eyes
A dark curtain containin'
Capable collisions of hearts
[Chorus]
Here we go (Here we go)
You and I (You and I)
I am me (I am me)
And you are mine (You are mine)
I'mma sing it out (Sing it out)

Baby, take a bow, woah
Who knew what (Who knew what)
We all want (We all want)
Is just a simple situation? (Just a simple situation)
I'mma follow my heart (I will follow)
It's led me well (It has led me)
Well, I'm here with you, today

When I first met you, (ooh)
I was so short of breath
I stared like a child who (ooh)
Who was faking as deaf
You smiled and I laughed (ooh)
And you asked me some questions
But baby, all I kept thinkin'
Was taking first kissin' lessons (first kissin' lessons)
Blessings seem to be pourin' (ah)
From right at the start
You searched deep down inside and know to follow your heart (ah)
I followed this path (ah)
It's leading to you
I've arrived at the 'X', baby, tell me what to do (tell me what to do)

Good morning, my love
It's been a while since we first talked
And I have grown
My eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

[Verse 1]
I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again

[Pre-Chorus]
Said how do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place
Where you said?

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
And when I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right
And when the plane came in
She said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face
Down on the mattress one
And you hold me and we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right
[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say

I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

Enough to make my systems blow (blow, blow, blow, blow...)

All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad world, mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

That they have stolen from us

Baby, can't you see I'm calling?

There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Find a balance in the middle of the chaos

Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder

Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Yes, I know that I'm losing control and
I want to take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control
I know I'm always pacing
And I blame it on the pressure I'm facing
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control

You were lookin' at me wild saying, ""Just go home,"" and

You're always saying that you read my sign and
Always wishing that I take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see

That's all I know

Mean, mean stride

Mean, mean pride

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift

Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide

And the space he invades, he gets by on you

To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent

Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit

So many people, so many problems, so many reasons
To buy another round, drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man, better than the other man

The shots of Tequila, man they'll say that they need ya

Teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands
Her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things

Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd

You walk by look at him but he can't look at you, yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground
You understand moods, but he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand, coming from a broken man, well
You try to live but he's done trying
Not dead but definitely dying

I was broken from a young age
Takin' my sulkin' to the masses
Writin' my poems for the few

Takin' my message from the veins

And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
Love you, Miss Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hold up, hold up

I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without gain
I know that beauty don't come without
Don't come without…

Short Skirt / Long Jacket,rock,imagine dragons,2011,532,"[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I want a girl with the right allocations
Who is fast and thorough and sharp as a tack
She is playing with her jewelry, she is putting up her hair
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds & Brittany Tolman]
I want a girl who gets up early (Gets up early)
I want a girl who stays up late (Stays up late)
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape
With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

I want a girl with a smooth liquidation (Smooth liquidation)
I want a girl with good dividends (Good dividends)
At Citibank we will meet accidentally
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen
She wants a car with a cup holder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She is changing her name from Kitty to Karen
She is trading her MG for a white Chrysler Le Baron

Find some models for wives
I’ll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Put down and that will be the end

And the animals and digging up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my father, miss my mother
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start anew
The models will have children, we’ll get a divorce
We’ll have some more models, everything must run its course

Right to the top

And I am left to sell

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

I'm just the same as I was

And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely

Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no day in a life

Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)

I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me

Wrecked,rock,imagine dragons,2021,64679,"[Verse 1]
Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

[Refrain]
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck
[Verse 2]
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late

I remember the words that you said
""Remember the life you led""
You'd say, ""Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud
Thinking of things that you should have done""
I'll see you again, my loved one

Easy Come Easy Go,rock,imagine dragons,2021,35840,"[Verse 1]
All my friends are gone, I don't blame them
I guess I'd move on, do the same thing
So I wrote a song to be my lullaby
Sing me to sleep at night, open my third eye

I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go

Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I'm runnin' from demons of my past
So I wrote a song to help me slow down
Keep my mind straight, but it's a bit late

Remember when you got sick, cancer of the bone
Everyone in school while you're sittin' at home
In your wheelchair of grief, find no relief
We were there for the ups and downs and there for the constant rounds of chemo
Yeah, you know that you are our hero
You were there when I was a zero
And I swear I'll make things right before the long night
Swear I'll make things right tomorrow
But as for tonight

Take a hit of anything
To escape it all, I'm suffocating
A sharpened blade of reality

Waitin' for the new year
Don't wanna waste my life chasin' white
Try to swim towards the light

Grinding my teeth out
But still the world will glamorize it all

I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes

[Verse 1]
Sitting here all by ourselves, counting all the people
As they pass us by
They gather all around and stare on down into a dark, dark pit
Don't go, please don't go
But they step on in, oh, they fall all in, they walk all over you
'Cause one step at a time, they all walk in a line
Down a false, false hope

[Chorus]
I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we'd hear

I'd fill up that pit, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand

Oh, how can I, how can I convince you to stay?
Where all the flowers bloom, the grass, it sways
And the rain, it pours, and the waves all roar
And the trees they grow
And the fallen crow soars down into that dark cold pit
And you follow it in
Oh, you follow it in

Well, I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes

Are floating past the midnight hour

Living Musical Demo,pop,imagine dragons,2008,34,"[Verse 1]
It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about, a sudden attraction
Between two with a few of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds, but it flies to the bottom
Baby I'm blessed to be here
Blessed to just bask in your presence, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a momеnt
It seems to be a lifetime

[Chorus]
I wish I had a lifеtime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you
[Post-Chorus]
Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, oh
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful

Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

[Verse 2]
She was coughing on the coolers as she asked for my number
I was living in a dream, feelings roll down like thunder
I never met my match, melodic melodies mumble
A cocky young thing meets a girl and I stumble
For the first time in my life I don't know where to start
With a brush in my hand I don't know when it's art
When I laugh she must smile, when I smile she must laugh
Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path?

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth

Look out for yourself

[Verse 1]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
[Verse 2]
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

My enemy-y-y-y-y (Yeah)

[Bridge]
They say pray it away
I swear, that I'll never be a saint, no way
A chair in the corner is my place I stay
I shake and I think about the powers at play, the powers at play
And the kids in the dark that were doomed from the start
The child in the basement, face to the pavement
Oh, what a statement, love is embracement
Love is a constant, love is a basis
He cannot be, she cannot be, they cannot be changed
Keep on praying
Goodbye

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy

To the hip hip hop and you don't stop

Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song:

[Verse 2]
Check it out, Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three emcees
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said ""damn fly guy I'm in love with you""
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said ""I go by the name of Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop
[Hook 2]
I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

[Post-Hook]
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 3]
I said M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then jam you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock rock y'all get on the floor

[Hook 2]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Post-Hook]
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what, America: we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast
Rock it up, uh, baby bubba
Baby bubba to the boogie the bang bang the boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat

Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says ""momma, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull""
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""man there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby but bubba, we're still friends""

it i got to leave this place i don't care what these people think i'm just sitting here making myself nauseous with this ugly food that stinks so you bust out the door while its still closed still sick from the food you ate and then you run to the store for quick relief from a bottle of kaopectate and then you call your friend two weeks later to see how he has been and he says ""i understand

Bones,pop,imagine dragons,2022,53467,"[Verse 1]
Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need (Ooh-ooh)
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives (Ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

[Chorus]
I-I-I, got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I, got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Verse 2]
Playin’ with a stick of dynamitе
There was nevеr gray in black and white
There was never wrong 'til there was right (Ooh-ooh)
Feeling' like a boulder hurtlin’
Seeing' all the vultures circlin’
Burnin’ in the flames, I'm workin’ in
Turnin’ in a bed, that's darkenin’

My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Bridge]
Look in the mirror of my mind
Turnin' the pages of my life
Walkin' the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leavin' the ones that never cared
Pickin' the pieces up and buildin’ to the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?

I-I-I, got this feeling, yeah, you know

Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

Humble / Feel It Still Medley,rock,imagine dragons,2017,32,"Humble
[Intro]
1-2-3
Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a trigger with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin' this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that tussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extra
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, now you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
[Chorus]
And be humble
Sit down
And be humble
Sit down
And be humble
Sit down
And be humble

Feel It Still
[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em back, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Guitar Solo]
