Salute,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,39836,"[Intro]
Everybody know I, do it
Y'all thought he was gone right?
Y'all thought it was over
Let me tell y'all something though
When he say EST for life
He mean that shit
It's the return of the underdog
The voice of the people
And he's still 100 words and running
So y'all better lace the fuck up

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells
Straight from the mother fuckin jungle
Fought with lions, tigers, and bears
Now I'm ready to rumble
Yeah the good guy never wins
I'll be humble
Whole city on my back
And I ain't gon' stumble
My hearts blacker than Ethiopian skin tone
Mama shoulda cut her fallopians
Knowing I was gonna be a problem when I get this ink on
Is Kells here?
Man please I been gone
And I'm never turnin back again
Cuz a block wanna trap you in
I done lost too many friends to the streets out here
Too soon to not know whats happenin
Call a taxi in
Get a book read the facts again
Ain't shit about us fancy man
Welcome to the east town
We happy in
And I'mma put this mother fucker on the map again
Heroes are remembered
Legends never die
I ain't dyin any time soon
What am I?
The hometown hero
Goddamn it with a legendary flow
And a name that's forever mine
Kells, can't nobody fuck with me
I'm on another level
Ain't nobody off of me
Propellers and feathers couldn't get you onto level and that's called company
Everybody I'm good
[Hook]
Yeah and when I step into the building
Everybody put they motherfuckin' hands up
(put em up, put em up, put em up, lace up)
Yeah and when I come into the spot
All the real mother fuckers gonna stand up

Who gon' stop me
Underdog of the year
Call me rocky
Underdog of the year
Call me rocky?
Don't act like you ain't copy

You can't knock me
This rock bottom
Who gon' top me
EST be the team that got me
Who gon stop me
You gon stop me?

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Everybody get the fuck out
Show me a rapper that you think is iller than me
I bet I pull their fuckin tongue out
Nowadays everybody be thinkin they ballin'
I came around and home runned on these players from the duggout
Yeah bitch what now
Hat to the side
Bags underneath my eyes
Got me lookin like I'm strung out
Can't even get outta bed
Without a pair of original chucks laced up
Then we lookin to run out
Look at who I brung out
Every show and every single city I step into
All the greatest people come out
Every single stage I'm on
I'mma dumb out
Yelling EST untill I blow a lung out
And that's why I love my fans
I swear my fans are my fam

And we never goin back again

End of the Road,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,98675,"[Chorus: blackbear]
Yeah, it’s a long way home at the end of the road
I’ll be pavin my own way, to the top, I be here to stay
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
All my life, I couldn't fit in, like a bad shoe
I was always too square, too cube, too tall, too weird, too blue
Forget them high-school’s hotties now I'm too cool
I guess I came a long way from that young kid
The school's most popular lame, no friends, no style, no clothes, no ends
Just a bed, fell asleep, never woke up again ('Gain)
Yeah, and my last prayer was don't ever let me end up like the people that's down here
'Cause the one that fear change be the one that don't care
Look at themselves and see somebody else in the mirror
But you can always pick me out of the crowd
Loud mouth with my very own style
And what I know now is don't ever pretend
And live every single day like you won't see it again
[Chorus: blackbear and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's your dying day

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I dedicate this to my teachers that never believed in me
And the mother that conceived, but ended up leaving me
I just wish y'all could see me smile, this big's grin on the TV now, oh
And I took it from the bottom to the top
From the holes in my socks, Ramen noodles in the pot
Used to rob them on the block, now they stop me in the drop
Middle finger up and that ain't gonna stop
I used to take orders, now I make bets
I used to scrub floors, now I sign checks
I used to push carts, now I push songs
I used to be there, now I am so gone
I fired myself, found a job myself
Established my name and then I signed myself
And what I tell myself, is you did this by yourself
And when I'm on so long, I'll be by myself
I'm gone

[Chorus: blackbear and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s the last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's your dying day
[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wish I could see their faces when they heard your boy spit
Wish I could know what they're thinking when they heard my first hit
'Cause I remember them wishing that I wouldn't get big
Now I bet they’re wishing they wouldn't of said that shit
I came out of a dying city brought back life
Everything they said I couldn't do I did about twice
Multiplied by the bottles that we popped each night
That equals out to a celebration, bitches more ice
Make it toast to the underdogs, toast to the team
Toast to the fact we this close to the dream
Pour one for my exes, used to talk reckless
But now I push Benzes and rock Rolexes
Came from the city and until they come and get me
Turn around and see the whole east side's still with me
And that's how we live it, you mans don’t change
Look, it's still the kid, still can’t tell me a goddamn thing, Kells

[Chorus: blackbear and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it's the last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's a dying day

[Outro: blackbear]
Yeah, it's a long way home at the end of the road
I'll be pavin my own way, to the top, I be here to stay
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day

100 Words And Running,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,30010,"[Verse 1]
Coming out the bottom of the mother fucking totem pole
Calling everyone who ain't believe like ""I told them hoes""
Now they on my scrotum though
And I've been grinding so long its like I gotta blow
Baby mama calling up my phone, what the fuck you want
Cause I don't owe nobody shit stop askin'
Haters get off of my dick, stop gaggin'
They know I'm schooling them, they tell me stop classin'
We already know that you the shit stop gassin'
Eck, and my flow is fucking sick dog
Make a bitch cough like a sick dog
Probably cause I spit raw
No fucking with this boy
Other rappers more uncool than when the fridge off
Damn I think my lid's off, more mental then Sig Freud
Mind like a mother fucking-unsolvable jigsaw
People ask my audience ""what you listen him for?""
Shit..cause I don't think Lil Wayne's come this hard
My God, then what that mean
Since I ain't son to nobody, then I must be king
Cocky with it, cause I know that can't nobody stop me with it
Wanna try? be ready to die, Kamikaze with it
Fuck a prince, I know I'm the real shit ya dig
Cause ain't no-mother-fucking-body done the shit I did
I'm the man where I'm from, but they call me the kid
Give me the crown cause if not then we taking that bitch
Mother fucker
[Verse 2]
100 words and running, 100 rappers that I ate still in my stomach
And 100 other coming, hustling for one-hundred a-hundreds
I don't give a fuck what you say, give me my money
Not college educated, but I can count a shit load
Connected like a constellation I can get you shipped more
Boy I do numbers with these verses check the info
I'm Machine Gun Kelly what the fuck's a pistol
What the fuck's a white flag
What the fuck's a price tag
What the fuck is beef? Fuck it show me where's the mics at
I will tear each one of them mother fuckers a nice ass
No homo cause we don't get dicked, we ain't like that
Nah bitch, should've hollered at me before
Cause ""fuck you pay me"" is now my steelo
And that goes for promoters, for the shows
For the verses, for the hoes
For the labels, what you owe
Bitch, give me my dough
I'm the big baller, shot caller of my age
19-year old Dwayne Wade
And the Eastside on my back, no matter what they weigh
Clevelands number 23 like I ain't know Lebron played
So what's up to all my fans who held me down since day one
Telling them Kells' the hardest that they come
Gave the real what they want and I did that
So come and blow a blunt with your boy give it here let me split that
And I bet they won't forget that
Cause rappers forgot how to be real
Forgot how they used to be before the deal
But I remember still
That's why I'm not a member of fame
Just raw talent who remembers the game

Man, I’m so Cleveland it's a goddamn shame
So East side I’m a goddamn gang
Said you ain’t heard about my goddamn name
Better ask around here, I’m a goddamn king

Earned my stripes like a goddamn beast
Tatted up no shirt still got sleeves
And I'm good from heights to 116th
Mother fucker this me, Kells
Fuck the fame!
Still roll through the blocks where they up them thangs
With the same hoes that tatted up my name

The Return,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,74579,"[Intro]
And they say they know me...
Get the fuck outta here
Only God knows what I've been through, man
So if you wanna talk, get your facts straight first
And if you really wanna know, let me ask you something...

[Verse 1]
Have you ever walked in the shoes of a giant?
Or had to fill the position of a boss before you were even a client?
It's no wonder growing up under the roof of a tyrant
That I would be the poster boy for defiance
Now I'm the voice of the silence
Fuck being quiet I've seen twenty years worth of violence
I'm tired, it's a burden for me to open my eyelids
Not an undercover cop but it's safe to say that I'm wired
I can't even get a grip on my life with pliers
I'm fucked up in the head
Close my eyes cause I see demons around my bed
So depressed, open them up hoping I'm dead
Thought the fame would make it better but it only fucked me over
Never used to touch a bottle, now I'm hardly ever sober
People want to be my friend
But where the fuck were y'all when I was ten
Eleven or twelve getting bullied and beat up in the gym?
I couldn't never get a girl, now all the sudden I'm the man
Students try to get back cool with me again, fuck 'em all
Because guess where they're gon' be when my record stops playing?
Gone with the wind, off in the record shop saying that ""Kells fell off""
I knew it would happen, stop hating, cause a month ago you was all over my jock saying
That I'm ""that mu'fucker""
But now I'm whack, mu'fucker?
Opinions change, but you cannot change facts mu'fucker
If you want bullet points then call me a gat mu'fucker
I'll lay my whole life out like a mat mu'fucker
Man, I've experienced some things that would stop you from eating
My schizophrenic cousin tried to end my life while I'm sleepin
My bummy uncle wanna call now that he sees me succeeding
My momma left me for a teacher, lost my dad to the preaching
Half my friends are buried six feet, all the rest in the precinct
Literally watched my Grandmother die from Diabetes
I guess my prayers were answered when my Aunt got Cancer and beat it
Now I want to get her out a job, give her the garden of Eden
I did a lot of bad shit, God got even
But for the price I had to pay, I wish I'd stopped breathing
My girl sat in the bathtub, eight hours bleeding
Hearing the doctor tell us our child's heart stopped beating
Fuck a million, I wouldn't take a dollar for a life
But I will do what's in my heart, and trade this dollar for a mic
I wrote this song in hopes that it could help someone get through the night
With no intentions of getting paid, I'm just doing what is right
I do it for the fans, no, the real fans
Who stuck with me through the storm cause they understand
That there's a genuine pain behind the words I'm saying
And they embrace me, so I thank y'all for staying
Ain't it crazy, that passion is my achilles heel?
Either that or keeping it way too real
But they don't know how it feels, to feed off the energy of a crowd
Step on stage and they get loud
Dad, I'm gonna make you proud
I know we don't speak right now but I think turning new leaves is what we need right now
I love you
And you may not see right now but I'm begging for forgiveness, I'm on my knees right now
You saw your son as a dropout
Stuck around when I ran
Saw your son as a felon
Now see your son as a man
See your son be a father, to a beautiful child
Or just see your son Dad, see me smile
Who would have thought what started at the bottom would someday grow?
From three people in the crowd, unpaid shows
Six people in the room, one meal a day
Another opening act where no one knows my name
Saw the demos that I passed out laying on the ground
Saw the rappers I befriended copying my style
Saw opportunities pass while these fakes got rich
Now I can't stop speeding like my breaks ain't shit
For six months I went through hell and back
Right at the height of my success all of the sudden doctors said I couldn't rap
I had a polyp on my vocal chords
Left with a choice, stop now or possibly lose my voice
But I woke up and recorded every morning till my throat swole shut
Coughed blood after every show because it hurt that much
I went weeks without even saying a word to myself
No health insurance so doctor bills piled on the shelf
But for my daughter and my fam, and every single fan
I pushed through it, now I'm back for y'all again
As for my competition, this is the beginning of the end
But right now this is my return, amen
Kells

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Whoever!
Would've thought that a little muthafucker from The Land wouldda came up and made them stacks?
Never was warm in the city, so I had to get on the record and come blaze these tracks
And I'm all around haters everyday, but I guess that's just what fame attracts
But fuck that, where the bucks at?
Man I need that green in my box like Apple Jacks
Matter fact, see me in a ride so foreign you can't understand
6 speed hitting 60, 0 to 3, so come catch me if you can
Speak in ebonics, give a fuck what Mr. Webster said
Let a smart girl read my dick-tionary, I call that ""Ms. Webster head""
Man I gotta get it, when I'm gonna get it, how I gotta get it, and whenever Imma do, I get that
Every moment I want it, cause every day I be grinding
So when you wanna make a move, I'm with that, yeah
Chip off the block
Monster in the booth taking off the lock
And put the shit back on when I'm on the top
So I got the game cuffed up like the cops
And I don't fuck with them
But the Eastside? Yeah, I got love for them
Anybody wanna hate on me, then get on my level, but you will never ever, so I got scrubs for them
Yeah, and I'm from the city where all of the good die young and the old don't make it
So we just hang in in the middle ground
Ready for whatever boy, don't mistake it

I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dream
I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dream

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, and they told me
All that glitters ain't gold
But I really wanna shine right now
And they told me the the sky's the limit
So I wonder if I can fly right now
Yeah, so I spread my wings
Jumped up and lived my dreams
I used to always say that I'd be fly
Now I got my head high
In the sky where the airplanes be
And now I'm reachin' up for the stars
Almost there
Told me I was dreamin' too big
I almost care
Till I hopped in my spaceship
And left the matrix
To a place where theres no more air
And now I go to sleep
Wherever they wanna be
Openin' my eyes seein' what they wanna see
And I never aged one year
Still a grown ass kid
You could never tell me what I'm gonna be
Cuz I might wake up
And wanna be king
And see the president
And wanna be the same thing
Or maybe be a pilot
And buy my own island
With a million dollars that I earned last spring
And of course
You know I'd have the worlds prettiest girl
Waitin' for me when I go away
And when I get back
Ima kiss her like the very first time
And take her to the malls and say
I want it all
[Hook 1: Aaron Lafette]
I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dream
Living life like a movie scene
Let me tell you what it feels like
I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dream
And I feel so free
Can't believe this real life

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, lights out and the whole city comes to life
See a star shoot past make a wish hope it comes tonight
But until then
Pack my bags put my headphones on
So everything can turn into a dream
And reality seems like I ain't been outta my bed in so long
I just wanna fly so high
And escape the real
Into a world that is all made up
So turn my alarm clock off
And lock the door
I wanna sleep until I can't wake up
Now with that being said
Bring me all the girls in the world
In a pool in my penthouse suite
And open up the shades
Get a view of the world
Out a window up 85,000 feet
And then we jump
Lava lamps floatin' around us
I guess gravity never found us
They always said whatever you do remain grounded
But Ive always been in the clouds my worlds groundless
So we go up, up, up we gone
And I dont wanna come back down
So ima do whatever whenever however that I gotta do it
To feel like I do right now
Cuz every days good
Every nights great
Yesterdays lobster
Tonight its steak
Spendin' my whole life
Lookin' for my place
Im a star
Shoulda known that it was up in space
We all came out of the womb cryin'
I ended up shinin'
Tell me what you think 'bout that
My life did a whole 360
Front to back
And now I get whatever I want in one snap
And I want it all

Lead You On,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,110551,"[Yukimi Nagano]
Twice I turned my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn't lose
Was it the blue light
Gone fragile?
Was it above the man?
In wonder, steady going under...

[Machine Gun Kelly]
Tell them drain the pool I'm sinking fast
Come and save my life before it pass
Scratching at the surface but the bottom's where I'm at
Only place my addiction will tell me that I'm free at last
So why the fuck you playing with my head? I said I'm done
Any and everything I had is gone I said you won
You promised that we'd only be together for a minute then we finish
But my life is passed another year why the fuck is you in it
Bitch I gave up everything for you even my house
Now I'm begging on a nightly basis to sleep on the couch
My counselor said I need to find a way to block the pain
I told him it was already too late she is in my veins and he said
[Yukimi Nagano]
Tell me what led you on, I'd love to know...

[Machine Gun Kelly]
Well, it's just that, when I felt her the first time I flew
Nobody gives me the high that she do
See, we fight all the time and she leaves bruises on my arms
But the way she makes me feel inside that girl can do no wrong
Now all my family hates me since I started fuckin' with her
And all my friends done left me 'cause they jealous that I'm wit her
I try to break it off but she gets me back with the feel
After everything she did why the fuck do I love that needle?
Please help me...

[Yukimi Nagano]
Twice I turned my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn’t lose

Look, this love's killing me, literally
Every time I start to pick you up, you finish me
Used to love waking up in the mornings and feeling you
Now I'm just ashamed wearin long sleeves concealing you
Bitch you wasn't shit, how the fuck could you do this?
Now my fucking life is ruined, I'ma kill you bitch I'll do it so I
Tie it up, stick that shit up in my skin and overdose on your love
So I can't have it again, uh

Kells, I'm a east side Cleveland wild boy, east side Cleveland wild boy
We got baseball bats like the Indians, and my team pop off like Cowboys
You a ""white-flag, throw-that-towel"" boy, I'm a ""jump-right-in-that-crowd"" boy
You a ""shhh, keep-it-down"" boy, and I'm a ""fuck-you, blow-that-loud"" boy
All I know is how to kill every one of my cells
All they know is they can kill anybody but Kells
I am untouchable, you would think I was in jail
But I'm in Mexico getting marijuana from Miguel
Bring it back into the States, put it on a scale
Measure it at half a eighth, put it in a shell
Split it then I roll it, then light it up like it's Independence Day
I got a bottle rocket, put it in the air
Snapback with my city on it, text back with your titties on it
Levi's, put your kitty on it, start grindin' like the Clipse is on it
Drink it 'til I get pissy, biatch, smoke it 'til I get dizzy, biatch
Lose control like Missy, but I'm a Bad Boy 'cause I'm with Diddy, bitch!

Is it possible for anyone to ignore me? (No)

So I cannot trust other people who capture closed video songs and put them out before me (Ha!)
And is it possible that I possibly delivered the illest lyrics?
Somebody call the paramedics! (Ahhhhh)
Somebody call the fucking paramedics!
Is it even possible with a lack of academics to get the credit in the city and never spend a minute in the class?
Fuck that, kiss my ass

Make It,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,8111,"[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
They said I got 24 hours in a dream, right?
Well I'mma show these people how to dream right
I go to sleep when I want to live my real life
‘Cause waking up doesn’t feel right
So I spend every single moment I’m awoken dreamin’ on
Teachers pinching me like, ""What is going on?""
And I’m tell em I'm fine
But they say that I’m wrong
They ask me where's my mind at
I tell em that it's gone
Somewhere in the crowds of a big city
At all of my shows, I got em all singing loud with me
And every night I see fireflies, no Owl City
Feet don't ever touch the ground, I'm in cloud city
Looking back I guess I always had a little less
But I always had the biggest heart in this lil chest
My auntie told me I would make it, just a little guess
Now little is just an understatement, I'm one of the best
I’m one of the million, look what I achieved
I‘ll be the statistics, I simply believe
‘Cause I remember back when people never tried to hear me in my school
Now they like, that kid went to my high school
Damn....
[Hook: Sean McGee & Machine Gun Kelly]
If you ever thought that you won't make it
Soon as it get hard, you just can't take it
No matter what you going through, keep waiting
‘Cause you gon make it
You gon make it
And this is for everyone with a dream
For single mothers working, you're a queen
And this is for the kids who never believe
Matter fact, I dedicate this to the street scene

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Hold up, let me put my cool back on
Wouldn’t be here without my team, I put my crew back on
And I’m a rapper but I will not put the jewels back on
My fans love Kells, let me put the fool back on
No shirt, jumping all over the house all around running wild
Food hanging out my mouth looking like a child
Like I don’t know my age
‘Cause all I do is smile
And instead of turning new leaves I jump into the pile
That's why I kiss my daughter every chance I get
And thank her mother for stickin with me thru all this shit
Dead broke in the store trading cans for cents
Almost Famous tatted on me, so I can’t forget
So I dedicate this to the mothers with the kids
To the fathers doing bids
To the teenagers who don’t know what having a parent is
To the workers washing dishes, and the players on the benches with bigger ambitions
You can do it, listen....

Chasing Pavements,rap,machine gun kelly,2011,124563,"[Intro]
I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love but
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up?
Or should I just (ugh) keep on (yeah) chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements

“You know, it’s crazy, man
I never thought music could have got us this far
Y'all have no idea how many sleepless or hungry nights we spent
On the fucking floor and couches just trying to get to this point
But no matter how hard the road gets, you gotta stay the course man
Keep chasing these pavements ‘til you can’t run anymore
Lace Up!""
[Verse 1]
Uh, fall asleep until the dream comes
Muthafuck reality
Happiness, I think I need some
So I overdose on fantasy
My life's equation ain't complicated
Just a combination of hate is denominated as stated
No rest plus the sess and abusive prescription meds
Times stress equals out to be the muthafucking mess that is, Kells
The boy with no home
That's why I live in your speakers through this song
That's why they turn it up so loud the bass hits
And you can feel me when I'm gone
And when I die, spread my message like the Qu'ran
Muthafuckas getting paid, I'm just tryna get saved
7 years of living crooked, I'm just tryna get straight
All this crack in my city even though these street's paved
Makes me wonder if I should let all my life's dreams wait
Or should I -

[Hook]
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
(Or should I) Just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
[Verse 2]
Bored out of my mind, I need a fucking job
But they ain't hiring shit, that's why I fucking rob (Gimmie that)
Had to hustle cause unless you got them test scores
Colleges only come around here looking for Brett Favre
For the next star, or if you 6'4""
And if you can pitch, but other than that shit you just pitch raw
That's what I'm pissed for (Why?)
Cause if you ain't worth a couple of dollars
These scholars looking like ""what do we need him for?"" (Huh?)
I'm saying, just because I ain't Kareem
You telling me I should give up on my dream?
You telling me I ain't shit cause I ain't working for degrees or on a team?
This country's flag is a joke
That shit should be painted green
Tell me when was currency valued over a human being?
When we stand for nothing, we falling for anything (Yeah)
But EST's for life and that's exactly what I'll scream
Misunderstood until they answer one thing (What's that?)
Kells

Should I give up?

{*New message*}
Ay, wassup man
I'm calling to let you know, bro
That, err, I don't know how long it's gon' be man
But, err, ya boy wants to do jail time
But you know, going around Shakers, we ain't kids no more
Still doing the same shit
March 30th is when I turn myself in and go to jail, man
Till then, keep making them hits, nigga foreal
You my best friend, my nigga, you saved me too, in college nigga now, foreal
Throw your hands up, my nigga, the industry 'bout to gain one of the best, ya know
They can't do it on their own
Aight, I'm going

[Verse 1]
It’s just the, trials and tribulations
This world is fucking crazy
When I’m screaming “free my man!”, the crowd’s screaming “congratulations!”
Cause we came from couches, to family houses, to corporations
And I know these streets are a dead end, but these streets embraced me
People I fuck with call me 'Kells', that’s what the streets named me
Fuck where you think I’m from or how I live, the streets raised me
And fuck the world for hitting my girl with that stray
And letting tears roll down my face onto her casket at the wake then
And I'm thankful for living this long, cause a lot of us don't make it
R-I-P to homie Rock who got shot after graduation
And Jo Jo was an animal, I guess that’s why they caged him
Caught in a vicious cycle of life as a young teenager
My history class is bullshit, they feed us false information
Fuck the founding fathers, millions died over Benjamin Franklin
My brother fought in Iraq, but it might as well been prison
Cause he’s home but his sanity ain't come with him
Fuck the world, screaming -
[Hook]
I pledge allegiance, to the streets
Hold me down, keep it G
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
That’s why I'm still standing in my Chuck T’s
My Chuck T's, In my Chuck T's
I’m standing strong, in my chuck T’s
I pledge allegiance, to the fans
To be the realest muthafucker that I can
That I can, that I can
Remain the realest muthafucker, that I can
Yeah, so when they lay me down to sleep
The last of a dying breed
R-I-P

[Verse 2]
Jesus died for me, government lied to me
These people say they loyal, I just hope they ride for me
And if I die before I wake then cry for me
And keep my muthafucking name alive for me
Look, I done seen some things that I would never tell my daughter
And did some shit that I'm ashamed of to get her what I got her
I know the Devil’s hot, but I got something hotter
And they ain't from Jamaica, but my boys are fucking Shottas
We never start no fights, but we'll go to war
EST tatted on us, that’s something we'll die for
These faggots had shit handed to them, but we earned it
Roll a J, yell out my window ""Lace The Fuck Up!"" then I burn it
Turned into the opposite of what they thought I would, skipping classes
Voice of a revolution of troubled youth, kiss our asses
And if government conspiracy's a lie
Then why the dollar got the all seeing eye?
Fuck this world, screaming -

Alice In Wonderland,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,23044,"[Verse 1]
Yo I was, raised on a seperate side of the track in the land where the wild things roam
Open up my closet see a tall leaf growin, pick a leaf off of the stem take it all to the dome
Callin it, the Alice in Wonderland, spiralin down the medium better known as time I'm stumblin
Come back to my senses from the sounds of thunderin, trees talkin to me wonderin if ill ever come again
Every single day until I'm seein the sun again
Starin at the ripples skippin rocks in the pond again
Stimulatin every single cell while I'm ponderin
And the green leaves are fallin and shrivelin like the Summer end
What shall I do, where do I go
I want the fumes in put the towel under the door
I'm feelin the dro, puff it in and releasin the smoke
Its not enough for me, I want it if u got it fa sho
There are, things talkin to me mommy I swear
I'm seein figures in the dark get up and nobodys there
Intangible shadows are fucking with me reaching for nuthin
So I take a hit of this Alice now I'm hopin for somethin
Fuck all the puffin, elmer it up get to the huffin
Treat it like christmas turkeys open up and get to the stuffin
See if I'm bluffin, I'm ready to go to the moon
Ill do whatever whenever promise it'll get me there soon
[Hook]
I'm lost in my own mind, where do I go
I swear This wonderland's not what I used to know
(voices in my head telling me to go to)
Wonderland (blisseded up feel the smoke run my hands)
Wonderland (twisted up, sip it chop it if you in)
Wonderland (Sit back let me how show u how it begin)
Wonderland (where my mind I think I lost in the end)

[Verse 2]
Take me to the twilight zone, no lights on
At the altitude where u be seein all the kites flown,(YEAH)
Family concerned and convinced that my mind gone
And they right, last night first class flights gone,HEY
Mommy why the fuck the flowypier gotta mouth now
Conversatin why I'm layin on the ground now
About face told me to get out now
See the revolution of tomorrow in the clouds now
So far gone, but I'm not Drizzy
Cleveland's own but I'm not Bizzy
Nope no bone well then who is he?
I don't even know anymore I swear I done went crazy (BAHH)
All this talk about the life and the ice in the right hands could get u the dream and a nice tan
But they don't say is the price is ya life plus a slice of ya soul as man and ya right hand
21 as long the cards set right
Drop on my saliva gave my card deck life
Queen of hearts tryna take away my best type
The Ace of Spade make a muthafucka bet right
Creepy crawlers tryna sneak up gimme bed bites
Hide under the cover keep intruders out my bed life
Hug the pillow keep it tucked under my head tight
So the toothfairy cannot get up in my head, night

Time, one more time
One more time
One more time
One more...

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we gonna do it uh
For the nights in the past we ain't do enough
For the unforgettable nights we couldn't take in
Cause we were too busy guzzlin' the gin
All in, til we spew it up
My city love me so whenever I'm home
I get the messages saying that it is on
Tell my homie Seven order up another zone
Me and Dubo getting high, Slim pouring the patron
In the club nights, Ciroc boys in the building bitch
Motherfuck VIP
I'm trying to see all the girls in the crowd get wild
And which one of em is trying to suck D-I-C
Somebody go and tell the DJ to play my shit
""Man I'm so Cleveland"", yeah that's my shit
Bottles all gone, take a few more sips
All these hoes got money, so I'm filthy rich
Rich, got they rich, and they love to spend it all on my click
They know we don't like clothes so they strip
Sign my name all across they tits, shit
Now where we at next?
I don't know but wherever we go don't dress
Half naked and my chucks still fresh
Half baked but I'm not no chef
Yes, let me hit it one more time like Brittany
Let me get 9 more shots like 50
Bitch I hustle, but I ain't Nipsey
Bitch I rage, who gets tipsy?
Last call for alcohol
So all the hoes go and get in my bed
And I say hoes cuz I mean more than one
Ima freak, so girl go and grab your friend, Kellz
[Hook]
One more time, Kells, Kells, Kells
One more time (x4)
Smokin out, pourin' up
Keep a drink up in my cup (x3)
Smokin out, pourin' up
LACE THE FUCK UP

[Verse 2]
And I'm, back on my bullshit
Walk in the room can you smell that ugh shit
Speed it up energetic Red Bull shit
'93 Michael Jordan red bull shit
And I'm so MVP, Derrick Rose ain't got shit on me
And I fuck like a porn star
All of the girls no I don't play ball
But they know that I got that D
I am on Jets, no NYC
Now I'm in stores like FYE
Saw my face on MTV
She suckin' with no hands like an amputee
Goddammit I'm me, dammit I'm Kells
I don't cuff hoes, what I look like jail?
I just fuck hoes, and I fuck them well
And make them pay me, call that bail
Bottles on me like a newborn
Gotta put the crew on
Pull up to the party in an all-black Yukon
Presidential shit, but I don't got a suit on
No shirt, gotta keep it hot like Tucson
And I rage, and I rage, better than yall
Any day, any place, bet I go hard
Step into the party and the cameras go awe
Little bit of liquor when im in my drawers
Oh naw, hell naw
I am wilder than a motherfucker, ain't I?
I can smoke all your weed dude, can't I?
I be smoking shit that make you do the macarena
I be on the east side, living with the gangster
I be fucking your bitch, she is a complainer

Kells, uh
I toast this for the team

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, waiter bring another round please
Bring that mu'fucker back
A couple more, they like it all please
Cause y'all don't know how to act
And I don't give a fuck! Can I live?
Cause we be doing too much shit
Just a couple of kids from Eastside of the 2-1-6
Bumping a dollar and a dream, real shit
Every day I wake up, higher than the night before
Blacking out every night on tour
5 AM, we jumping in the pool in our drawers 'till the cops come
Run run, fuck the law
And I was born to be wild
Sex, rock and roll and weed piles
Running from the old and senile
Follow in my steps, then you walking a green mile
'Cause trees in my pockets like my denims a greenhouse
Leave my team? How?
Tell me what's my age again?
How many hours 'till I rage again?
This is the story of a young boy in the page we in
Say that he off chasing fame again
And there he goes; Almost famous, bitch
Yeah, Kells
[Chorus: The Naked and Famous & Machine Gun Kelly]
The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Uh, half naked and almost famous
Wild nights in all those places
I be, half naked and almost famous, famous
And when I get on, I ain't changing
Tell the world ""Lace Up!""
Kells

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, come rage with the Machine, bitch
EST the team, bitch
Never got a college degree
Too busy raising hell like it was Friday the 13th, bitch
Fuck clothes and fuck hoes
Hundred dollars worth of munchies, truckloads
Eighty-nine cent slushy in the cuphold
Don't know where I'm going but we gone - what's home?
Maybe I'll just Mapquest my dream, and it'll say the address was me
So what I really wanted all along's been camouflaged fatigued
I've been a pro, I just dodged the league
California dreams
Where we sitting up under the Cleveland weather, man
Wishing for heat, I guess I need to see the leather man
Uh, I just wanna be young forever man
Roll the Peter Pan, light it up and let's Neverland
Muthafucker I'm, gone

Thought I Was Gone Hello,rap,machine gun kelly,2011,3569,"[Intro]
I would like to dedicate this, to uh
Fuck it

[Verse 1]
Open my phone up, every day to 80 voice mails, from 80 different callers
But to keep it 100, y’all really know Kells, nah
Underestimated, but over stood, let’s just hope I’m a knock, knock, on wood
But either way I’m on another level thank the swisher
Ladies love when I’m around say I look better than the pictures
God damn right
I coined embrace the expression that I am fly
Cause I’m high as fly and above all of them land's life
I’m like Picasso with this damn mike, listen up
I gave the game stability, I am the missing crutch
Look how they mentioned us, call me collective
Even know they hate me, you don’t have a choice but to respect it, ha
Peter picked up Pepper and I just picked the dream
And fell asleep now everything I do’s a movie scene
But I just wanna live, and never act, blow a pack and run it back
[Verse 2]
Yeah
Now everybody from my city knows the name Kid
My father thought I was a screw up, till I blew up
Take a look at what the fame did
From stains to stainless, fridges in my cribz
There's bitches twisting the illest, getting lifted like the planes is
Them one come and go, but the high stays
Trying to keep my mind free is them junior high days
I guess we came a long way since MySpace
Seem like my name is all over the country like the highways
But they telling me the that home where the hate is
Well fuck that I’m gone then my spaceship
Been ready for take off
See me on Venus with extraterrestrials, puffing the greenest of the space raw
Already reaching and god willing if I make it to tomorrow
I’ma wake and dedicate this to the ceiling
Cause the fans make sure I’m on my mission
This is the pursuit of happiness fuck a million
We just over here living

[Verse 3]
Which is why I never put down the blunt
Surrounded myself with the realest
Which is why I never put up a front
But I did turned my back though
To everybody’s opinion, and gave the critics a reason to kiss my asshole
Hi bloggers I know my skin’s a little different
I guess I’ll blame the lack of presence on my skin pigment
I’ve been dough, I’ve been fly as then rest of them
I just always been ill and they got the medicine
Guess I wouldn’t want me around either
Vocals sick enough to fuck around and give listeners the jungle fever
Look at me now pops up in the sky box, a few clearer than eye drops
And I rock all the shows all the hoes and more
Open up my closet looking like a clothing store
I don’t never wanna grow up, Peter Pan
So roll it up and lets hit neverland, Kells
Gone
[Outro]
And everybody who just trying to make a living
Doing whatever they gotta do to get it, put your hands up
Whether you work on the streets or in the buildings
Everybody that is handling they bizness, put your hands up
Me I’m just chasing the dream while they sitting
So everybody who isn’t bullshitting, please stand up, please stand up
You in the front row dedicated to my fans
Though I was gone, I’m back

I Know,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,17551,"[Produced by JP Did This 1]

[Hook: Ray Jr. & (Machine Gun Kelly)]
I know, you don't wanna see me like
Ridin' through the day and night
Tryna get my money right (Uh)
I know, you hate to see me doin' right (Yeah)
Switchin' cars and changin' flights
Tryna get my money right
(You killed this shit, Ray... Kells)
And I know (x5)
(Uh, lets get this money, fool)
And I know (x5)
(Yeah, lets get this money fool)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Until these dollars in my pockets fat as 10 wallets
Man, I'm tryna ball until my paper stretch like Ben Wallace
I got respect, now I just need power like 10 sockets
Plus I'm fly as fuck
Man, I must'a came outta the womb with 10 rockets
Gone, ""B-b-blast off""
I grinded my ass off
Now my hotels filled with 20 bitches with they pants off
And we blow that cash crop
Puff, puff, pass on
'Til that green is gone
Shit, it looks like we mowed the grass on
C-L-E, man I rep my town
Everyday bleed that orange and brown
Muthafuck what you talkin 'bout
'Less EST comin' out your mouth
I'm puttin' on my gang an' shit
You puttin' on your hatin' shit
Your girl told me I'm the best
I ain't have to say shit
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ok, everybody knows I be on my job (Yes)
Label me the Diddy of my city, doin' anything for a penny
An' when I'm ""In Da Club"" call me 50, making people ""Whoa"" like Black Rob
Don't nobody ever wanna see me shine
But you can't block the sun
Since I'm a star, that mean we're the same
Which means Imma shine no matter what
So call me ""Kid"", call me ""Kells""
If you ain't about shit don't call my cell
I had my fans before my deal
And they hold me down cause they know I'm real
So say I'm this, call me whack
But when I come around better tuck your sack
It's EST all around the world
So the whole planet got my back (Bow)
Fuck your cars, fuck your clothes
Walk up in the spot, take all your hoes
20 dollar Levi's, I don't need Green Guys
Alphabet Cake baked all them O's
My hotel, my hotel?
You wanna know what happens in my hotel?
Is that your girl? I know her well
She was here last night, now bitch go tell
[Refrain: Ray Jr. & (Machine Gun Kelly)]
Tryna get my money right
(Everyday I'm out here)
Tryna get my money right
(Yeah, you know I)
Tryna get my money right
(I heard they hatin' cause I'm)
Tryna get my money right
(Mic check, ok)

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
So why you talking down now?
Because I run your town now?
Because I'm ring leader of (This, this, this)
And you a clown now
Because you fell off bad as fuck (True)
Because I'm on, you mad as fuck (True)
Because me and my team made it ourselves, you lookin' mad at us
Or maybe cause the streets you call your hood rock with me more than you
An 'member in the same building the crowd watchin' me more than you
Do I get paid more than you?
No but your a fuckin' fool

Victory Music,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,4424,"[Hook: Britni Elise]
I put it all on the line and pray that God gets me through it, through it
Came here with nothin' and I don't know any other way to do it
And it’s my victory music, yeah, it’s my victory music, yeah

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I like the way this feels man, uh
Kells, bring it back to the map, right up in the middle of it's where you finding me at
Labels wanna holla, this is where they’re signing me at
Cause my city told me they need me so I’m grindin' for that
Same clothes, same street, same chucks, same feet
Same kid I used to be moppin the floors up every week
I paid the cost to be the boss
Let’s just say I ain’t cheap, cause now the same kid is living off a check from every beat
I’m from Midwest, where they don’t forget where they’re from
What they’re representing their home mines just tatted on my arm
And I forever be about it as long as air is in my lungs
Speaking to you as the kid and I'm as real as they come
I made a dollar out of cents got a whole nation respect
Before I was 18 and I did that without a check
See I used to be a lame now I’m posted in the game, in a top spot
Top drop, money ain’t a thing
[Hook: Britni Elise]
I put it all on the line and pray that God gets me through it

Let me get them, up north, let me get them, yeah
Let me get them, where’s that, let me get them, east coast
Let me get them, Midwest, let me get them, go

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, dedicated to my fans and everyone who wanna see me win
I swear my life’s a major motion picture from beginning to the end
Only thing is I ain’t Hollywood and this here ain't pretend
Haters try and pull me down but I’m too high up in the air
Here I’m try and talk down but I’m too high to even care
I’m on top of the world and I got my baby girl here
She don’t worry about a thing as long as daddy’s right there
Yeah, from the benches to the league, fought through hell and back to get a dream
Cause as a lightweight, you gotta learn to use your pounds right
From the bottom to the top this is for victory sounds like

Been Through It All,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,32288,"[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly & (Cheri Dennis)]
(I can say that I made it, cause in my heart I'm the greatest
I've been through it all)
This song is for everyone out there
Who's ever made it through the hard times
For everyone who's ever had to struggle
For what they wanted in life
This song is for everyone
Who had to sit through the dark days
Before they saw the light
For everyone who's been through it all
Shout out to my fans, man
This one's for y'all, baby!

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uhh, I been through it all
Crazy, because I never thought I'd say that (Naw)
The cost to be the boss, never thought I'd pay that (Not at all)
Headed to the top, without the friends I've had since way back
Near death experiences, watching my life play back
Damn, and I have never sold a brick
But I can show you where to get it
Like I can show you how to flip
My whole life has been a hustle
Since momma bounced on her kid
And I ain't never scared of drama
I was born up in the shit (Let's go)
Cause it was once upon a time, mu'fucker
We were fine and I was just a little snobby mu'fucker (Right?)
Then it changed, now these people wanna rob me mu'fucker (Oh)
New environment, now Pops' like ""Get a job muh fucker!"" (Whoo)
Yeah, so I did that, wasn't with that, so I quit that
Told them about my dreams and then they laughed
But I spit that, fire
Couldn't deny it, so the choir that would chip, yeah (What they do?)
Shut it up, and still I won't forget that
Man fuck y'all!
And I won't put that behind me (Behind me)
Even though I left the past (Past)
And I'm still the kid now (Now)
Even though I left the class (Class)
I'm on, and it took everything from A to Z to do it
So anything I'm talking, I've been through it
I've been through it all
[Hook: Cheri Dennis]
I've been through it all
Had to hustle just to make it through the struggle
But I still won't let that get me down
Put my feelings in the music
So the world can hear me all around
Every town and every city
Every state and every country
I can say that I made it
Cause in my heart I'm the greatest
Because I been through it all

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, in April I was born, at 14 I was a felon (Uhuh)
By 18, I had been to more funerals than a reverend (Damn)
And right when I felt like I'd give it up, look what they sent me
My beautiful baby girl straight outta heaven
And I loved you girl
And even though that was never part of the plan
And people doubted it because of who I am
Fuck, I hope they understand
That at 19 with the world in my hands
I stepped up and handled that shit like a man
I've been homeless, I've been broke
Done every drug 'cept for coke
I done fought for my life, been jumped, shot at, and more
I've been rich and I've been poor
Had to steal from the store on nights there wasn't shit to eat
And seen my best friends go
Damn, so what the fuck could you possibly say to me? (Huh?)
The verdict is I'm the truth, but you can thank today's jury (Yup)
But if you wanna judge, come walk a mile in my chucks
But the world sucks, better Lace Up, uhhgk
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
Okay, I've been made out be a monster
But the only thing aggressive about me
Is the will that I have to conquer
I told them I was the best
And they doubted, but no longer
Out of all the starving artists
They could hear my hunger (Sup?)
And if that's wrong then I don't wanna be right
I'm always dreaming so I'm gone in the night (Shhh)
And now it's reality
I'm calling home like ""I'll be gone on this flight""
But how can I contact a place that doesn't exist in my life?
Home, I guess that I'll just be alone for the ride
And live vicariously through another's eyes
Adding on to the list of lies
So my girl doesn't trust me for shit
Probably cause after my momma left I ain't trusted a chick
Shit, and my father drowning his problems with the bottle
While I'm praying my auntie can see tomorrow
Cause cancer ain't a joke
And I just lost one of my best friends to the pen
So I don't wanna live again
I been through it
[Hook]

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly]
And if you ever have a dream
Don't be scared to chase that shit, man
You can have whatever you want in this life
Don't let anyone tell you different
And shoutout to my fans for helping me achieve my dreams

Invincible,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,249996,"[Chorus: Ester Dean]
Voices in the air
I hear them loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

[Verse 1: MGK]
As my, world turns
The heart beats
Not only in my chest
But the heart in these streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre beats
I am from the city of evil, came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, whats up?
Inception shows me as a dead man walkin', but reflections shows this kid's still got it
Let it be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family because I'm not a human being
And anyone under my level that’s coming at my spot for the top
Let them have it, cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells
[Chorus]
I hear voices in the air
I hear em’ loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just want to listen
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh I am

[Verse 2]
Waking up sweatin from the stress of being caged down
Everything I write is played out like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes in the wall but they don’t know the path
Even if I told them it all, they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all of these dreams and put on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
And just run, till the day comes like Rocky’s movie scene
And I’m on top of the world, look up and scream like this is me, this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself in the game when I found myself in a cell
Then I found myself in the fame when I lost myself in the pills
And you cannot mess with me still , seen them boys and they winnin
Underdogs of the year, Cleveland boys in the buildin'
What the fuck is a ceiling I’m taking this to the top, and when I leave the whole world drops Lace Up Kells
[Chorus]
I hear voices in the air
I hear em’ loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear nothing can compare
I just want to listen
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh

Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, I am Steve-O
Hahahahahah, ah-hah!
Cobain's back, yeah, Cobain's back
Got all these crazy white boys yelling Cobain's back

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly & (2 Chainz)]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's
(Yeah, 2 Chainz!)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me 2 Chainz
Eat your girl, wear my necklace, call it food chain
I'm a wild boy, been that way for a while boy
All I kill is beats and pussy, still ain't went on trial for it
Southside, my chain glowing, If them lames going then I ain't going
My aim good, my pistol dirty, chopper clean them like dish detergent
Kobe Bryant but the sicker version, Big Meech but the spitter version Meek Milly!
Stacey Dash but a thicker version (Maybach Music), getting head while the engine running, ugh!
[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Aye, I'm a wild boy, strapped down like a cowboy
I'm really in the game, you just a towel boy
I pull up in that thang all on them alloys
With so many karats on, Bugs Bunny'll die for
Your bitch call me Steve-O, cause I ball like I'm D-Rose
My neck be on sub-zero and I won't save her, no hero
My wrist done cost me a 'Maro, got your whip on my wrist
You keep my name in your mouth but it keep your bitch on my dick, nigga!

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Bitch, I got my beanie and my hoodie. Here go the dick, bet you know where to put it
I'm rougher than Buckwheat's hair, you niggas softer than Jell-O pudding
I stack them up, I keep counting digits, you falling down to London bridges
Laughing at you bitches like ""Na-na boo boo"", bitch, cause I'm back up in here
I rip it up, I put it down when it get mean, 2 Chain, Meek Mill with the nicotine
French Montana and Machine Gun Kelly, I ain't gotta tell you how I act on 16
Gangstas don't dance no more, pussy ass nigga better stay in his place
How many times you seen one fucking rapper kill so many mother fucking rappers with an 8?

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's
[Verse 4: French Montana]
R-r-riding with them young boys, rolling up that O-G
Rather have a hothead than to have some cold feet
Homeboy it's a new day, all my jewels is Blu-Ray
On your wife like Cool J, beat it up like the new Dre
Money here be too grown, f-f-fresher than a newborn
They try to sign a whole group, started from the group home
Moving like a boss move, MGK my dawg, fool
You know I'm a wild boy, cocaine cowboy

[Verse 5: Yo Gotti]
Had a show in Cleveland, law shut it down
Dropped that gangsta shit, security couldn't control the crowd
Bitches on that drank, my niggas on that loud
Niggas talking foul, my pistol talking POW!
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, I'm a dope boy
Top gone (transparent) where it go boy?
Lamb fettuccine sauce, inside broccoli
Got that Machine Gun Kelly and it's screamin' ""Cock me""

[Verse 6: Machine Gun Kelly]
Everybody shut up (shut up) Couple of them ready to do it different
Whenever I tell them bitches to come up (come up) And I ain't talking 'bout the stairs, I'm talking for air
Somebody light a blunt up (blunt up), call me Steve-O bitch, I put a nut up
In front of your mother's face like it's nothing. Puff it till my eyes yellow when I'm with them, sun up (what up?)
What I need a shirt for? What I need a shirt for?
Tatted up from my head to toe like what I need this shirt fo'?
What do I need to work for? I smack the boss at my job, boy
Fucking hoes like I'm Austin Powers giving golden showers, that's wild boy (Kells)
[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Every day I, wake up, to the same shit
In the same house, with the same bricks
In the same clothes, with the same kicks
I might as well be in jail
Caged in, stairin' at the wall waitin' for a change but
Dad telling me I gotta get a job
Couldn't pay the bills so the lights turned dark
Them Cleveland boys got it hard
Oh my god, we been living like this too long
Just to lose it all in a week
My people too strong
Get it? Me and my boys be blowin'
Puffing on weed like this the lawn
Me and my boys tired of being here
That is why we gone
They say we wouldn't amount to nothing, huh?
Y'all thought we was bluffing, huh?
Fought every temptation shit, I guess I'm David Ruffin huh?
Nowadays, we don't gotta do that dirt, tell my boys they good
And nowadays my little girl won't have to work, moved her out the hood
Look man, I done been through it all, and I'ma damned if I got this far
And if I let them strip me of this message let these haters take my heart
This for the ones that had it hard, the ones like me, the underdogs
This for the ones that waited for them clouds to form, please god let it
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Oh, oh, you can't see my tears, in the rain
Underneath it all, we're just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
All around the world it's just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
No, so, I let it rain

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Oh, and they mad that I made it out the city (What?)
But if you look I'm still out in the city (Oh)
Before everything I had clout in the city (Yeah)
Toured the states and never bounced on the city (No)
Shout out to everybody that's proud in the city (Hey)
Everybody cheering in the crowd from the city (Hey)
Everyone that never had doubts in the city
Cause they know I represent what we about in the city (Woo)
And I'm still laced up, tell the world that’s nothing changed
Till it's hundred dollar bills in my pocket, then nothings change
If my team ain't with me, then I don't wanna thang, tell them I'll go broke before I run out on my gang
EST over everything
100 thousand plus, cult fan base yea that is us, my songs tattooed on they body troubled youth, we bad as fuck and what?
Nobody gave a shit about for broken mirrors
So I care less about appearance
Just as long as they can hear us
We're fearless, we're stupid, we're dealers, we're losers
We're killers, we're orphan's, we're addicts, we're stealers
We're shooters so kill us
We are what they say we are until conformity hits us
Or those clouds come down and take them all with us, please god let it
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
You can't see my tears, in the rain
Underneath it all, we're just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
All around the world it's just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain

Woke up, time to grab my phone book

So what? Living life in the fast lane tore up! (Hey)
Tryna eat my toast but I had so many drinks I'm throwing up
Hit the school with fo' of us (Yeah), one rollin' up that doja
Then we open doors up, smoke coming out the Rova (Hey)
Always celebrities, man everybody knows us (Yes)
Teacher ask why I smell like smoke? Bitch cause we just toked up!
I don't give a fuck, cooler than seven below bruh
Anaconda dick, Chuck Taylor toes keeping my nose up (Hey)
Gonna keep our hopes up (Hey), on the block where they keep that holster
Where we live like every day's the thirty-first of October

[Pre-Chorus]
From the block to the burbs
From my spot to the curb
Got the drink, where's the herb?
All my bitches whats the word?
Take this fifth to the face

I'm like ""c'mon dad, you know your boy got all A's""
So I gotta go, manager calling my phone, I guess it's showtime (Yeah)
Three cars deep, full of hoes that we met online (Damn)
Brought the house down, blog and saying that ""Kell's shit""
Facebook and Twitter updates, ring Kells bitch!

Hotel room, penthouse at the party where they smoking fluid

Living life like a movie

Party hard, cops ain't knocking, they on duty

One Time,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,8706,"[Verse]
Motherfuckers callin' my team Scarface, pushing that white boy like Tony
From the blocks to the island like Coney
We poundin' (?), young gun away from nothing, but a couple of pennies
2-1-2, ahh, couple of minis
Now can you feel me, it's just that real biatch, Kells, biatch
Caught ya never snitchin' in 5th Grade, I wouldn't even show and tell biatch
I'm from the city where menace made
I had a daughter, now I'm trying to father a junior, like it's Eleventh Grade
Neighbors look in my garage, like where the whip at?
Haters looking around like where my click at?
Right over there, makin' sure my profit is avoiding the dispatch
Only thing that ain't moving is where my lips at
Cause all that chit-chat with me? Nada
I'd rather stuff these dollars in my pockets, tell the (?) make em burst like Piñata
And though my partners medicated, they ain't ill much
But they do regurgatitin', throw the bills up
This is my life, born winner since momma pushed out a fetus
And these haters over-crowdin' my penis
6'3"", big feet, Chuck T's, guess you know what that means
Get on your motherfuckin' knees and suck these, bitch!
And I will never put no one above my baby mama
So with these hoes, I keep my poker face like Lady Gaga
Give them some intercourse and flight, middle fingers up
That means I give a flying fuck, dumb dumb, listen up
Now let me tell you some rules to this game
Everybody isn't real, only a few remain
With that said, you should never become a business mans friend
Cause his intentions from the beginning is them back ends
And most important, never forget where you from
Cause after it's over, guess where you gon' be? Running home
And last off, never let 'em take the love from us
Loyalty is everything, EST or it's nothin', Kells
[Hook x2]

Fuck, one time, trying to keep us from doing the biz

The green give me amnesia
While it's Kells poppin' out the goddamn speaker

So maybe the crititcs slow and I'm too fuckin' fast, dawg
There's three reasons why I am better than your favorite rapper star
I can rap hard, I got better fans, and I'll beat his fuckin' ass, dawg

Cleveland is the city where I'm at
Bring the cheese and turn this bitch into a muthafuckin' rat trap
Fuck the chorus, I been hated and they know that
Fuck the forest, chop the trees and then we blow that
I'ma Taurus, but I don't bullshit
You can get the fuck out or come and get this full dick
And maybe call up a couple of fans
And they didn't come over because they were scared
Because they were intimidated by the noise or maybe by the mohawk in my hair
Or maybe my boys who don't even rap
Or the many celebrities that it attract
Instead of adapting to ski mask
A matter of fact how 'bout, you know what, give me that

The Arsonist,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,10313,"[Intro]
Kells, never been a punk
Always had hands, tall skinny city boy, white skin black chucks
And everybody that wanna challenge I can do whatever you do but you ball-

[Interlude]
Man hold up, hold up, hold up, you gotta stop, stop that, stop goddamn
I don’t think ya’ll know what's going on right now man, check it out
This is the kid, MGK, Machine Gun Kelly, and this the mother fuckin’ mixtape, 100 words and running, Lace the fuck up, Kells!

[Verse 1]
Uhh, Kells, never been a punk
Always had hands, tall skinny city boy, white skin black chucks
And everybody that wanna challenge I can do whatever you do
But you ball, I dunk (Swisssh)
You thought them up
Sleeping on the bottom, I'm on top of the bunk
So when the Machine’s getting something to eat
You wanna breathe, bitch please now use that tongue
But don't use that wrong and tell your boyfriend who you used it on
She calling me daddy and her boy Lil' Jon
So if we gotta problem then let's get crunk (Yeaah!)
I-I am what you wishing for
The dropout will receive what you paying your tuition for
Said you wanna rap (why?), tell me what you spitting for
I am the only great white
Get it, what you fishing for?
[Interlude 2]
Hold up stop stop, I just said I-I am the only great white and I'm a white rapper
And great white like a shark... 'what you fishing for?'
Ya’ll don’t get it...

[Verse 2]
Ok fuck that bring it back
This is what I gotta do to get my city back
No we not the east or southwest any that
Straight down the middle like a goddamn Kit-Kat
Yea, yea no mornings because there isn't no sleep just yawning
Trying to get a house on the prairie on top of the hill
Now where's my awnings
Ow and if we recording, put this song in the obituary
Have my manager notify Yonny and tell him I killed his beat, I'm sorry

[Verse 3]
But Kells is just a beast like that
Got a beauty on my arm call Disney tell them that the beast is back
We beat that, weed is crack, show me where the freaks is at
Not a stain on me, you would think I'm where the bleach is at
Up front let me beat the back
Give an uncle like my niece react
Came without a snorkel but she show me where her beach is at
Surf's up, the cat got me riding her body waves, positions change
Now I'm all over her chest like Axe body spray
And she can't even go down and get my rocks off (Why?)
Cause so many haters dangling they rip my cock off (What?)
Nah, I'm just playing, but yo for real though
How 'bout you get off my sack and buy yourself a dildo?
Or buy yourself some steels yo, selling 16’s like pills yo
I'll get your career rolling, rolling no wheels bro
So what I gotta steal fo?
Even though I'm in the spot that ya'll kill fo
Cause if you watch Finding Nemo y'all the Krill fucking meals ho
What the deal yo, what I need a deal fo?
I got every coast in the country dancing to my songs; heel-toe
Entrepreneur’s hero, 19 years older than zero
Nine digits follow the zeros on my check
Now where’s my pillow?
Goodnight

Get Laced,rap,machine gun kelly,2011,19403,"[Verse 1]
I'm so God damn gone I don't know where home is
Feeling real sauced up no boneless
I keep it G, fuck keeping up with the Joneses
Smelling so funky that you would think that I was homeless
And the fans like, Kells stop playing with him
That girl's man like, bitch stop laying with him
And the haters on the internet tryna' be thugged out
But them dealers and killers man I was staying with 'em
Eastside Cleveland to the death yo
Fuck LeBron, the Kid never left y'all
Forget the number twenty-three man it's EST
You see it tatted on my chest, we the best y'all
Couple stacks if you wanna get a verse from me
Make a diss track if you wanna get a hearse from me
I got the gift already so I fuck bitch ass dick shit if you wanna get the curse from me
Cause everybody be wanting something that I got
Leaning on me like a tripod
But I'm already leaning up with the liquor
They be running up like do or die guy, Kells on their iPod
And I'm fucking with these trees real heavy man, real real heavy man
Blowing up brown good, the shit's real pettigrand
Mix it with the red I be calling that shit spaghetti
I'll be all up in the mountains blowing on that white yeti, man
End of the day I'll be chilling man, what's new
I'm for the people not the rappers man, fuck dude
I'd rather be a lame than rely on a name
Or rock sunglasses in the dark man, fuck cool
And the album coming soon y'all bear with me
Laced up, Chuck T's brought a pair with me
Hit 123rd for the sour Dies
Though I'm blunted in the car looking like a flare's with me
The people here with me hold me down, all dogs homie, no meow
That's why my circle as small as a penny cause ain't no-one sold me out
But funny how everyone knows me now
And before all this we had the streets on lock, man, Dub knows
Ask Ash what it was 'fore we book shows
Me and Slim in a 1 bedroom, no money no food but now we eating good though
Now I could go (Where?)
Anywhere up there, all I gotta do is push go
Give me the green light meaning give me good 'dro
From a land far far away where the wood grow
And I'm staying real throwed like a pitch
Cop a whole zip put it in a dish
Blowing something real real evil so I call this witch
You got dirt so I call that ditch, you bitch
[Verse 2]
The dope boys feel me, the suburbs feel me
Your girl definitely does, cause she here with me
So really you don't have a choice but to deal with me
And you like my shit, keep it real with me
Matter of fact, let's keep this one hundred
If I was pocket change I would be one hundred
You would be a nickel, even when I'm nothing
I was still a two fifties equalling out to one hundred
So keep it one hundred, Kells is that boy
Who resuscitated the city dog, that boy
Who got a whole coast behind him, that boy
So if you want the real, listen to that boy
And I'm that boy, 20 years old
With the world on my shoulder like a fur coat
Used to be square now I'm in a circle
Sipping Merlot, for real man? for sure
So about it you'd think I was from No Limit
Real white boy rap, dog, no gimmick
Bringing the game back to life with no clinic
Because I let 'em see the real me, no tinted
So I'm in this, the new face of
Hip hop I gave the game a shake up
And this brand new change comes in the shape of

Grind all night, sleep once in a leap year
Never had a beach chair, city of the hard knocks
Let one of us make it out the city, bet we all rock
Coming out the East Side, where they do not play much
Clouds always loomin, we dont see the suns rays much
Still I got the paper, gotta make sure the lights on
Its the mistake on the lake to you, but this is my home
Tatted it on my arm, bet I represent that
Homie Im from Cleveland, I will tell the President that
Hardest year, we been there. Made some of the greats here
Midwests best, this is MGKs year

Heading to the Flats, get it poppin off with Steph Floss

Faith in my teams, we keep gettin closer every year
But we got the King though, so hopefully we overcome
Yes I have a dream, and I no I ain't the only one
Art Modell tried to steal my heart, but we brought it back
Thanks to Cleveland Clinic, now they call them kids the cardiac
Rock Hall, Science Center, Tower City, all of that
Warehouse District, Euclid Corridor, and all the Flats
You know that Im a Tribes fan, and I love Slymans
Crocker Parks a perfect place for me to spend some time in

All Alone,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,9066,"[Intro: Collin Hilton]
I'm all alone (all alone)
In the unknown (the unknow)
So on my own (on my own)
Someone help me in my escape
I'm all alone (uh)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
What I'm gon' do now?
I'm going through withdrawls from this loneliness
I'm captain of my ship, without a crew now
Sinkin in the deep end, I ain't even in the pool
Broke the mirror cuz I'm sick of knowing all I got is you now
My knuckles bleeding, my back is against the wall
Screaming at my shadows, they ain't saying nothing at all
I'm going crazy, conversation when nobody talks
So tell me how my ears are ringing, when ain't nobody's called
Huh? Yeah
But in this life of mine, friends are expendable, living in a life of crime
Every morning pillows soaking, from the nights of crying
Knowing the choice is either jail or dying
But here we go
[Pre-Chorus: Collin Hilton]
Here we go, down this lonely road
Searching further for something more
In this dark world, I'm so alone
Can someone rescue me from my own

[Chorus: Collin Hilton]
I'm all alone (all alone)
In the unknown (the unknown)
So on my own (on my own)
Someone help me light the way
I'm all alone (all alone)
In the unknown (the unknown)
So on my own (on my own)
Someone help me in my escape
I'm all alone

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, in a position I wasn't ready to take
Pushin' the countless decisions I wasn't ready to make
But I do it, refuse it I can't
Its stupid as faith
This is the life I chose and I dont have room for mistakes
But everyday I wanna give up
Stomach hurtin like I did a sit up
Anxiety tightens my throat like a hiccup
Thinking about the things in my past I can't get rid of
Every single thing I eat I gotta spit up
And every time I get up my world is spinning, so where am I facing
Can't stop thinking, my mind is racing
Somebody come get me outta here, cuz now my only hopes of escaping is the sound of a (bang)
Please save me
[Pre-Chorus]

Where.. do.. I start to.. begin
When I thought I couldn't win.. I gave back in.. to.. myself

Yeah, they're making us crazy (crazy)
Don't give up on me, baby (baby)

[Verse 1]
I'm just out here chasing my dreams, girl
But it's crazy cause that dream cost me my Dream Girl
Promised you I wouldn't change before I left
Now I think leaving is the one thing I regret
Cause the one thing I possess
It wasn't materials, wasn't checks, wasn't cars, wasn't clothes, or any part of success
It was you, and without that in my life I'm depressed
You became the new drug I couldn't get
And every time you came over I was on some shit
Either too fucked up, or bitching about how you dress
Even though I remember when you would lay with me when I ain't have a bed
Buy me food and come wake me up with some head
Girl, you had me like a dread - locked down, but I wouldn't show it
Instead got on that bus and left you blowing in the wind
Shit, and it's fucked up cause every girl I'm with I see your face
Now summers here and I'm sitting outside your place singing this shit

Yeah, they're making us crazy (making us crazy)
Don't give up on me, baby (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I never thought for a minute if you showed me a picture of my life now, that you wouldn't be in it
Took me a couple years to say I loved you, but I meant it when I said it
Wasn't much of a romantic, but you get it
Didn't really smoke, but when I rolled it up, you hit it
And we lit it up - shotgunning our kisses
And fuck these other bitches, baby, fuck these other bitches in my bunk
Staring up at all your pictures that you sent me on my birthday
Remember that? Cause I couldn't forget it
Like I forgot yours, but I'm sorry and I said it
I admit it, I fucked up and I lied, but this is true
I don't know what home is because I'm lost without you
Just like our favorite song, yeah blink 182
Now I just turn it off when it comes on, I wish I hated you
I used to have someone at 3am that I could call
Now it just rings and I don't get nothing at all
Where you at girl?

Come on pick up!
Yeah hold on give me a minute

Letter To My Fans,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,31174,"[Intro]
Kells, to my fans
Hold me down mo'fucka
And that's all I say

[Verse 1 - Machine Gun Kelly]
When that crowd leave will you stay for me?
And if I don't become what they thought I was
In the time I should and my hype dies, would you wait for me?
Or be ashamed of me if I chose to bow out gracefully
Cause I know if I don't wanna lose myself
Then Hollywood ain't no place for me
What if I told you I ain't quit
And these drugs still was my rival
Would you regret the fact that you sobered up
And had more heart than your idol
Or accept the fact that I'm just human
Borderline suicidal
And is it blasphemous that these two fingers mean more to me than my bible?
Lord help cause I'm cause I'm hell bound
With the weight of the world I'm held down
Feels like I'm in hell now, maybe that's why I'm havin' this meltdown
Maybe that's why I hate fame, maybe that's why this J's lit
Cause I speak the real and get criticized
So I inhale and don't say shit
And I wake up, to the same shit
Cameras on with their hands out
And that fake smile that I hate now
Cause they the one say I sold out
They the one that will break out when I needed food for my daughter
And I'm the one who can't grow up so these fans replace my father
And these girls replace my momma, they give me love, I don't take it
Cause fuck love, these fucking hugs weren't around before I made it
And since I don't have no family EST is all that I got
Either drop me now or you down for life
Man it's EST or it's not
[Hook - Dubo]
This shit ain't right (uh)
Cause whenever their wrong, oh it's my fault (my fault)
This is my life (my life)
Now tell me are you gon' ride 'till the wheels fall off?

[Bridge - Machine Gun Kelly]
'Till the nightmares done
'Till the grey hairs come
'Till the friendship disappears that we've had since day one
I said this is my life
So tell me are you gon' ride 'till the wheels fall off?

[Verse 2 - Machine Gun Kelly]
What if this is our climax?
What if everything peaks here?
What if we never get big and these days add on like leap year?
What if you were in my shoes?
Do you think you can fit 'em?
Or would put that gun to your fuckin' head
And regret the fact that you in 'em
Cause this ain't living, this shit prison
Whatever you see in videos, this isn't
Whatever I thought I knew, shit I didn't
Dealing with the consequences of my decisions
Traded the life of a lonely child
That couldn't find anyone to get through
For a life that's filled with cameras
Critisize everytime that I move
For the love I got for my fans
And the loyalty for my man's
Equaled out to the shows we dreamed of
With them bodies pack to those stands
And I did what they say I can't
So I'm living proof that you can
Go be great, chase your dream
We only got one life and one chance

Halo,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,86819,"[Verse 1]
Uh, this ain't no halo over my head, bitch
But dear God, can you forgive the sinning
For everything I done did since my beginning
Because the devil around me so much that you would think I got a death wish?
Yeah, and the voices in my head get louder
Watching my career disappear like powder (Poof)
Wish I could rewind those hours and get my life back (Back)
Strike that, clinging to this weed like a life jacket (Yeah)
Fuck rapping, I was really living everything that I was spitting, bitch
What's happening? (Wassup)
Fights daily, nights crazy, dream chasing till the drugs came in
I was chopping up them bitches like Jason
Had a muthafucker's face laying on the cold pavement (Uh)
Wake up, take 'em, now I feel sane (Whoop)
Spending every penny in the studio slaving (Yeah)
Me and my mob working any odd job
Praying that this little dream was gonna feed our babies
Save me Lord, save me Lord, what the fuck is this curse you gave me Lord?
Everybody think I finally made it Lord, but all I am now is a slave, my God
[Interlude]
And Revelation says
""He will wipe every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For the former things have passed away""
EST for life, muthafucker!

[Verse 2]
Ughk, put that halo around my neck, bitch (Bitch)
And gimmie death
I'm twenty-two and this twenty-two on my left, God bless
Maybe I'll finally sleep
Maybe they'll return what's originally mine, cause finder's keep
Maybe I will be great, and this voice of mine was designed to be the finest key
But, I'm losing faith (Ok)
Everyday they got news to break
Like my single flopped, and now I ain't hot
And they don't know if Imma ever gonna see the light of day
It's ""My labels mad"" or ""My albums bad"" or ""You ain't living up to the hype we thought you had""
Or I lost a fan, or I'm in cuffs again
Yeah, meanwhile I ain't there to be my daughter's dad
Fuck what's meant for me, because I don't ever wanna become a celebrity
I don't ever want someone to feel less than me
So put your camera down and stand next to me (Right here!)
EST, Everyone Stand Together
And if I, ever R-I-P, then I know everything I stand for's forever
Lace Up!
[Outro]
And when you play this song
Hold your head high, muthafucker
Don't ever look down because of who you are

Ayo, first off my name is
Fuck that, check the playlist
Bitch I'm tryna blow up like the Al Qaedas
But why y'all wanna be famous?
So I can pay for protection and pretend to be gangsta?
These rappers is five foot tall talkin' 'bout gang-bangin'
I'm 6'3'', I pee make 'em yellow like Coldplay is
Six deep up in the rental Honda from Avis
Bad bitches give me brain that explains the mindless behavior
But fuck 'em and never mind 'em like a hater
This rap shit is wack I'm goin' back to gettin' paid under the table
This industry turns me off like I forgot to pay my cable
A bunch of males on these labels tryna stick it in my anal (what the fuck?)
So I fuck these girls cause they're rear-ended
I said motherfuck the world 'cause it's near-ended
And if you're scared go to church
Other than that go get a shirt with my name on it
Get your peers offended
You're tormented by my face, huh? Yeah
That makes you think of what you ain't, huh? Yeah
So shimmy shimmy yah shimmy yay
Get your old dirty ass out the way
Hold up, (brrrr)
Kells, Kells, it's XXL
We've got some wonderful news and I just wanted to tell
Now I know you and our freshman issue don't sit well
So we said fuck everyone else, gave you the cover to yourself
I ain't ballin' but I'm at the free throw
Didn't go to college, but I know this gringo is copied more than a fuckin' Kinkos
Mijo, mis amigos will cut you into burritos
And feed you to the seagulls, your career's over, finito (Fatality)
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a jackass, I'll backhand my country's presidito
I don't take part in politics
Where I'm from we call it deep-throat
I'd rather fuck me a bitch and X-Men like Magneto
Call me an asshole but be tactical
'Cause the wrong vernacular could turn something spectacular to a massacre
Microphone damager, Midwest assassiner
A Cleveland cannibal, able to eat any of you faggots like bananas
My cabinets are full of plants that make my lungs blacker than Janet
High as intergalactic planets, I think I work for NASA
My Chucks are classic, body marked up like my manager's calendar
Fans are fanatical still I'm slept on like these mattresses
Wake up, can you see me? Somebody get binoculars
I'm on top of a mammoth slappin' two animal activists
Livin' up to the standards I got stuck with as a rapper
A havoc, problematic, psychopathic, bastard, ambassador
(Cough, cough) hotboxin' an Acura
Pants saggin' gettin' head from Tabatha
Bitch I be that skinny motherfucker
Cleveland's what I'm reppin''
They already know the answer
Ain't no motherfuckin' question, it's Kells
I got more bars than a jail
I got more heat than the sun itself
You would think I was a member of Hell
You would think I didn't have any manners the way I use this Biggie beat for myself
But if anyone of you got a problem than let me call P. Diddy up on the cell and we'll tell you:

On Fire,rap,machine gun kelly,2011,11236,"[Chorus: Mike Posner]
I am on fire
I feel like I can't stop burning
I am on fire, yeah
I feel like I can't stop burning

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Tell me, why does everything that's bad feel so fucking good?
Devil in a red dress, she killing me, I knew she would
So bury me one foot for every inch of heel she's wearing
I'm in lust, still, I can't trust this bitch, but I keep on staring
Matter of fact, fuck that, no emotions, let's get high as fuck
I don't need a light, she fire me up
Pullin' out white like a Styrofoam cup
No hair cut, but she lines me up (What the fuck?)
I don't even do this shit
What would happen if my friends knew this shit?
And why the hell can't I refuse this bitch?
This shit is crazy

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
I am on fire
I feel like I can't stop burning
I am on fire, yeah
I feel like I can't stop burning
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
She got her legs spread wide for the kid
And she begging me to come and get up in it
Touching herself while I take off my 11's
Got a girl back home and she calling every minute
So I pick up like, ""bitch, mind your motherfucking business""
I'm serious, I'm trippin', no, literally, I'm trippin'
Out of all those drinks, anything could have slipped in
Not to mention what she had me sniffin'
But she grabbed my dick, told me ""forget about it,"" and bit my lip
I told her, ""turn around while I turn the music loud
""Whenever the bass hits then you strip,"" and then she did
But she pulled a little baggie out of her panties
And put a pill on her breast
My mind said no, my dick said yes
I'm willing to do whatever to feel her sex
This shit is crazy

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
I am on fire
I feel like I can't stop burning
I am on fire, yeah
I feel like I can't stop burning

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
And she told me, ""speed it up, fuck me good
""Beat this pussy up like you should
""Lay back down, keep it up
""Let me show you how a real bitch do""
All she wanna do is get dick and run
All I wanna do with this chick is cum
I've been in the pussy for about two hours
But I can't feel my shit, I'm numb
Her legs shaking and my legs do the same
But it moves to my chest, to my brain
To the nerves in my face, so I can't feel that motherfucker
But this ain't Novocaine, bitch, quit playin'
I don't even know your name
""What the fuck you do to me?""
She said, ""I'm the same one sellin' Oz to Mike P
""And the one that made you OD""

Save Me,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,45318,"[Instrumental]

[Verse: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, from the bottom of the ash I rose
Yeah, to the top I go
Where I'm from its cold
But I don't need this coat (nah)
Keep my sleeves rolled
Got my city's area code on my shoulder (whattup)
216 forever in my soul
Swear to God every single night its gets colder
No heat so we all around that stove
Like ""fuck this broke shit"", petty ass hustlin
Couldn't even sell one zone
Slim still workin' at the store and the only time we ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here
Prayin for a rainbow to lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to
Never gave a fuck if we went gold
I just wanna be able to say that ""I made it""
'Cause real EST mufuckas don't fold
Real EST mufuckas don't break up, real family grows old
Real EST mufuckers representin' for the city where they came even when they gone
And fuck this throne, ain't no kings
No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the eastside
Just these broken homes and those screams
Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets
Fiends outside trying to get they fix
While my first born in here trying to get sleep
Muthafuck this rap shit
Try buryin' your boy six feet, let me show you 'bout real
Try telling me that you can't make it up out the city 26 dollars to multi-mills
Face inside of the XXL
Then try coming back to the eastside still
Well bitch I did, and it's still the kid
Labeled a Bad Boy before this deal
What up Slim, Dub, Xplo, Dre, Swirv, Ash, my boy BK
And everybody from the beginning that bled with me knowing I would be here one day
So as I roll through all the hoods that raised me
Lookin' at the house of pain
I'ma runaway from the ones that pay me
Hopin I'll stay the same
[Outro: M. Shadows]
Can't you save me?
Can't you save me?
Can't you save me?

Teach them how to grind, how to climb on that fucking ladder (Ladder)
How to keep that money on their mind and make their pockets fatter
Cuz the only thing that matters loyalty, honor, and the G-Code

All We Have,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,54327,"[Intro: Anna Yvette]
All we have is right now
All we have is right now

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Oh, oh, yeah, staring out into the unknown
Voices in the wind telling me to come home
But I'm scared
Scared that all this time I've been gone
I'll open up the door and my little daughter will be grown
And I'm cold, tell me why I'm so cold?
Probably cause a shoulder turns every night that I'm on the road
Probably why I can't smile every time that I'm on the phone
And why I'm acting so wild every time that I'm alone
Save me!
I suffocate myself beside the bed
Tryna cut the circulation of these thoughts inside my head, like
""Do I hate me? Or do I hate them?""
Either way I've held grudges since I was holding a pen
My father had me think that my cousin was dead
Just to hide me from the truth, how can I look at him again?
But this is life, and in life we learning to live
And when the past dies, this where it begins 'cause
[Chorus: Anna Yvette]
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Question, what if tomorrow never comes?
And everything you said today couldn't be undone?
Cause all it takes is a bullet from one gun
To take another's moment away from them, one love I know
See I was just an only child growing up
Just frowns cause I never seen a smile growing up
But you? You were a friend, always down growing up
Give the word, knew you would've blown trial growing up
Fuck! How could we let all this petty shit blind us?
How the fuck did we let the devil find us?
See, we were supposed to be best friends 'til the end, you promised
How'd it take that fucking night to remind us?
I only said I hated you cause you're the only one that's ever honest
Man I said I was wrong, let's get beyond this
But it's crazy, 'cause I never thought my text apologising
Would be the reason that you died driving
Damn

[Chorus: Anna Yvette]
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)
All we have is right now (Go hard or go home)

Ugh
I swear that I can feel 'em fuckin' with me (Fuckin' with me, fuckin' with me...)
Oh, I swear that I can feel 'em fuckin' with me (Fuckin' with me, fuckin' with me...)
Every night I feel 'em fuckin' with me (Fuckin' with me, fuckin' with me...)
Hear me wit a feel of ugh

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wake up screaming in my sleep every fuckin' night
Open up my eyes to cold sweat, bloody clothes from my nose
Erhk - Nothing nice
Father, I've killed a man, but I had to do it
Only thing is he is me (Damn) – how the fuck you couldn't get me through this?
My skin is blue-ish, voices in my head saying
""Don't be stupid all you have is in that bag you better use it"" (Do it, do it, do it)
Cut it (Cut it), snuff it (Snuff it), puff it (Puff it), shoot it (Shoot it)
Only one I trust now is myself, these motherfuckers Judas
Gun in my pillow 'cause all I feel is this paranoia
Holes in my wall from all them nights that I was feeling for him (Hey)
The devil's here (gunshot)
But I'm still awake (gunshot)
Then I broke the mirror (Why?)
'Cause I seen his face
Even my bitch corrupted
I fucked her pussy 'till it's bloody took it out and then she sucked it, told me that she loved it (Bitch)
Everything is black, I think I am deceased
I am a ghost without the bed sheets (Boo!)
X speak
[Verse 2: DMX]
If a beast's what I got to be, then so be it (What?)
Fuck it, if I got to live it (Uh), then y'all gon' see it (Do it)
Eat it, shit it, live it - it's in my blood
That’s why I get down like bud, from the dirt to the mud
You fucked up thinking shit was sweet, but shit in the street (Ah)
Make you split the heat, to the back of his head, make you spit teeth (What?)
Leave his loved ones in grief
And I don't wanna have to be the one to tell you shit deep
But man, shit's deep

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & DMX]
I swear that I can feel 'em fuckin' with me (Why?)
Every night I feel 'em fuckin' with me (Why?)
Please God tell these demons stop fuckin' with me (Why?)
Every God damn night I feel 'em fuckin' with me (Why?)
Please God

[Verse 3: DMX]
The street's still the same
Ain't right, if a nigga can't still feel the pain (What?)
But still kill the game (Come), still keep real and aim
I get down one way, we could keep it that one way or take it to gun play (Yah)
Let a nigga know, if we going to walk this dog (Uh)
If we ain't gon' talk at all (Come on)
Make a nigga have to, talk with the 4 (Eh), that’s the only language you know
There you go, pop pop pop, now, there you go (Woo)
And I hate that I can see snakes clearly (Nah)
They don't even try to hide, it's like they be trying to get near me (Come on)
Most of y'all don't hear me, it's like I'm talking to myself (Ah ha)
These niggas so dumb, got me feeling like I'm talking for my health
Ain't like I'm talking for the wealth, 'cause there ain't no money in the truth (Ah ha)
Shit, I'll live this shit for real, y'all make it up in the booth (Oh)
Till a nigga lose his tooth over some shit he didn't plan on
Wasn't prepare for, really couldn't stand on
[Verse 4: Machine Gun Kelly with DMX]
Fuck it, turn the cam on, tie his feet and his hands up and watch him
I'll be back up with that heat to get his tan on
Now that's for fucking with me (gunshot)
And that's for my dog
This because where you going you not gonna need that arm
The street's is talking, ""Uh oh, there they come""
Thirsty for that blood (Redrum, redrum)
Do you know how it feels to be so mad you would kill?
Or to be so trapped when you scream your throat cuts like jagged pills?
And whenever you close your eyes everything inside you dies
And all the high's, crimes, and lies come alive, muthafucka

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & DMX]
I swear that I can feel 'em fucking with me (Why?)
Every night I feel 'em fucking with me (Why?)
Please God tell these demons stop fucking with me (Why?)
Every God damn night I feel 'em fucking with me (Why?)

Runnin,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,55507,"[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly & Planet VI]
Where?
Why?
Mayday!
Runnin' I, runnin', I ain't runnin' away
I told you! You are never going to be shit
Runnin' I, runnin', I ain't runnin' away
Just stop now, you're not gonna make it
Runnin' I, runnin', I ain't runnin' away
That's right, get your shit and run away again
Run muthafucker, run
'Cause I'm so tired of running

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I'm so tired of running, that I've worn my soles out
To the point that my toes is out
To the point that I can't look back
And even if I did I still couldn't see where I started out
Can't see home for miles
Lost like another orphan child
I’m only grinning cause I'm supposed to smile
So I do it for the ones that are down and out
Proud one of those is gonna be a spokesman now
But I'm still running, running, and I don't know where
All I got to my name is one pair
Of laced up chucks, five bucks, and a chip on my shoulder that's so big, that I cannot bare
I done lost my friends, family, and home for this
And for that I have lost my mind
Kept my faith, lost my direction
I'm just praying that I haven't lost my time
Go! (Go, go, go)
[Chorus: Planet VI]
I keep my head up with my feet on the ground
From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm goin'
Ready to face all that's in front of me now
'Cause I'm so tired of runnin'
I'm walking through the fire, cause there is no way around
Moving in the same direction wherever the wind is blowin'
Ready to face all that's in front of me now
'Cause I'm so tired of runnin'

[Refrain: Machine Gun Kelly & Planet VI]
Runnin' I, runnin', I ain't running away (Ahuh)
When are you gonna stop running, huh?
Runnin' I, runnin', I ain't running away (Ahuh)
Face it, you're gonna end up just like your father did
Runnin' I, runnin', I ain't running away (Ahuh)
You don't know how to fill these shoes
The whole world wants to see you fail, and you're gonna let 'em
'Cause I'm so tired of runnin'

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
And I'm so tired of strugglin'
I'm so tired of hustlin'
I can feel my heart fill with hate
I'm so tired of lovin'
I was supposed to be great
I'm so tired of duckin'
Tired to coming home from a job being fired from nothin'
And shit I'm tired
From the nights a muthafucker took that ride
To make that dream, come alive
To wake up in the morning to a nine to five
But I gotta do it if I wanna survive
Because in the city where I'm from it's either do or die
So choose it wise
Because you could lose it in the blink of an eye
But even in the darkest times
It's proven I- (I, I, I, I...)
[Chorus: Planet VI]
I keep my head up with my feet on the ground
From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm goin'
Ready to face all that's in front of me now
'Cause I'm so tired of runnin'
I'm walking through the fire, cause there is no way around
Moving in the same direction wherever the wind is blowin'
Ready to face all that's in front of me now
'Cause I'm so tired of runnin'

[Outro: Planet VI]
Runnin' I, runnin', I ain't running away (Ahuh)

Who remembers my broke ass when I had no food for my stomach?
Who remembers my haters when I was keeping it G? (I do)

Hold about two phones, I don't call shit (Shit), Wild boy 'cuz I start shit (Shit)
Rager 'cuz I mosh pit and this ""a"" stands for ""anarchist"" (Yeah)
My heart is Antarctic, burn one and get car sick
Floating like a carpet bitch I'm higher than the starship (Let's go)
Tatted up so I can't work, you would think I got paid first
Beat that pussy out the frame, you would think that bitch gave birth (Yeah)
All these sins, you would think that I hate church
Said ""Thou shalt not steal"", but fuck that, I'll take her

You can bet a nigga, if I said it nigga, ten out of ten, it's no white
Tell me what's not to love, why hate?
Want a real answer nigga, and I'll wait
Treat my 'rari like I'm in a roller derby
Put the shoes on and I skate
Say you don't like me, nigga, you know me, nigga?
See a sound of me, that’s hate
Say you wanna rap about it, wanna talk about it, and ain't live the shit, that's fake
Say it's coming back and this locking up sound like to me, that's flake
Say you don't rock with me, you don't fuck with me

Edge of Destruction,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,87674,"[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I'm humble because I know what it feels like to be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me...
I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around, now I'm somebody

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get a heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me 'cause I'm nothing like them, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he's proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, ""Wow, peep his salary""
Way back when I was feeling defeated (Rrr)
When inspiration, motivation was needed (Rrr)
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'm a keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli' sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listenin' to Witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirling
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's ""Fuck the world"" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Gone) Uhh, for the block I (Go) to that spot I (Go) to the top I (Go)
Screaming ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive
Head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""

[Verse 2: Twista]
Twista, I remember thinking I would rather die
Then go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I'm ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs, everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back and forth on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y'all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimping on everybody
And certain mothafuckers that want to get in my circle I tell them naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy, naturally
And I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s ""Fuck them"", I don’t even bother
And who knows what's next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Midwest, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in, better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level, wherever you wanna go
Everybody put they hands up, I'm ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up, yeah
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Gone) Uhh, for the block I (Go) to that spot I (Go) to the top I (Go)
Screaming ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive
Head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
From the back streets to the packed seats
On the block, running from the cops, like athletes
Ugh, whoever would've imagined Lace Up could've got me to the finish like track meets?
And when everybody’s hot, I'm past heat
And if I don't need the fuel, don't gas me (Yeah)
It's been a long time coming since 100 Words And Running
Mothafucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then you know we gotta have it
Don’t anybody ever snitch, get pinched, you forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget (Blah)
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby's mother
Never gonna know his daddy, tragic
Why's the government gotta lie to get money? (Huh?)
Why's the federal reserve gotta take from me? (Why?)
Why should I be fighting for another country?
Have you seen my city mothafucka? We hungry! (Urghh)
Representing for the middle of the map even though me and mine are coming from the bottom (Waddup)
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
You really think that Notorious B.I.G would believe these guys? (Nope)
All these internet thugs that the media finds?
You wanna talk about grind?
Look at me in the encyclopedia, what name is in it?
I bet you see mine, motherfucker that's Kells
Skinny boy, six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still, I came out on T-O-P
So this is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had to him was some headphones
So he pick a song, and he turn 'em on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape and the kick in the bass
That's the story of MGK
Lace Up!

On My Way,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,30821,"[Verse 1]
Okay, now they say home is where the hate is
Pulling up, ""Hi, haters!""
I know, I've been on a hiatus
Caught up in the lights I've been blinded by Las Vegas
Ain't it ironic before I was twenty one
I put my future on the table and I won?
See they told me, ""Life's a gamble""
Now this is my casino
Made sure my fellas good
Now I'm Robert DeNiro, sipping Clicquot
With the girl that held me down from the beginning
My team throwing up L's
But it's funny 'cause we winning
A million talked down, soon as I rose from the bottom
But opinions assholes now, everybody got 'em
So they ask me why I do it
I do it for the streets
Heard momma got out the grill
Man I do it for the grease
Man I do it for the five pack of Hanes wife-beats
That I wore like everyday to show my brand new ink
Shit I remember working jobs, just so I could hit the dance up
Never had a date, so I really didn't dance much
Couldn't buy my own, so I just borrowed my dad’s tux
Told him, ""Keep the loafers"" kept it gully with my black Chucks
So you can keep watching the stars
But me I wanna be 'em
And I just beat the odds
I guess we can call it even
'Cause the underdog
Went from flipping patties at a Fuddruckers
To living lavish than a muhfucker
God damn!
[Interlude]
Ooooooh weee!
Haha, we got stories for days man, for days. They just got to listen. Ay Slim! Oh and if y'all don't know, that's like my best friend right there. But any way, ah, it's safe to say we're on our way man. Bout time though. Shit! Ay you remember when my dad kicked me out right after we met and I showed up at your house the next day with a U-Haul like ""hey you wanna move in with me?"" Haha, or matter a fact, nah, nah, you remember the time we had those two girls over and Dub called like ""Yo, these dudes tryna jump me up here at The If!"" Oh, that's what we called the store across from our crib, ""The If"" 'cause it was on a 130th. But anyway though man we left the girls there sitting with the doors open, sprinting to the store, ready to fight, and this fool closed like ""ahhh got y'all, I was just playin'."" Damn I still wanna whoop his ass for that shit. Nah, nah, nah, nah, matter fact you remember when you wanted to buy your first keyboard? So we went and gathered up spare change like everyday and walked into that bank with a heavy ass bag of nickels and they were lookin' at us like man, what the fuck? Hahaha, we too grounded to be Hollywood. Man, this about as Hollywood as Im'a get. Peep this!

[Verse 2]
Hold up, okay I heard they want the classics
My life's a movie like the Truman Show without the cameras
They look at us like we a couple Boyz N Da Hood
Four Brothers 'till the end like them boys in The Wood
So I Light It Up, for them Friday Night Lights with the team
In The Notebook, holding my Requiem for a Dream
I was Superbad in the class I just Dazed off
So I played sick and lived Ferris Buelle's Day Off
Back in Cooley High, students used to nickname us The Goonies
Every night we blacked out, shit they should’ve called us roofies
Get out of bed Half Baked, roll another doobie
So many snacks up in my house they call the crib Scooby
Blowing oowee man I swear this as good as it gets
Godfather told me, ""Keep doing that music shit""
He said, ""Your piece of the American Pie is waiting""
From the bottom to the top, Almost Famous

Chase N. Cashe
Can the drummer get some, huh?

[Verse 1]
Indeed, phat tracks, good weed
Anthrax, you know we loud, baby the band's back
Smokin' hash, now my hashtag's ""pass that!"" and I never need cash back
My green is on the credit of the fact that I'm the muthafuckin' man, jack
Coming straight out of the land where them Cavs at
Good stock of tree to take me I get higher than the NASDAQ
Burn somethin', me and my friends fried
Spicy chicken sandwich, some burgers and French fries
And my cherry slushie, that's red as my friend's eyes
So goddamn high I fell asleep in my friend's ride, shit
I'm fucked up, but these the days I live fo'
For every J I smoke I fuck a bitch, I'm a nympho
I wouldn't trade this for a million bucks
My best friends, my blunts, and my chucks, what's up?

Bumpin' that new shit
La la la
This my jam
So roll it up and let's float again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
[Verse 2]
I wake up to no rules, no bed
We crashin' on the couch
Leftover food
No bread, I guess we eatin' out
A couple hoops, fuck yeah, you know we ballin' out
And after that? smoke sesh, we never on a drought
We got them swishers, king size Zig Zags and all utensils
OG kush big bags, edibles in the kitchen
Plus the air match the smoke around my tattoo'd initials
So fire up the muthafuckin' bong like its a missile
Where the bitches? Somebody call the cell
Tell em bring the liquor, some mixers, and high heels
I'm half naked and all these ladies is as well
And you would be if you burn like we burnin', I'm hot as hell
Shells stuffed with the finest product these dealers sell
I swear we done ran thru more papers this summer then the mail
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, let's get by
Live for the moment let's get high
And we floatin' like

Hey, welcome to Fuck-You Burger, May I take your order?
Yeah, Let me get uh, let me get sixteen double double cheeseburgers
Ok, we got sixteen double double cheese burgers
Four of them without cheese, but still give them the same love as you would a cheeseburger
Eh, add two more burgers (Oh, y'all fat as fuck)
Eighteen burgers total
Let me get, let me get five of the circus fries
Okay, we got five of the circus fries
Three of them just put one French fry in there but put the same amount of sauce as if all of the French fries were in there (That is retarded, are you high?)

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, there I go
Two clicks north of the Bronx
Whoever thought she would of found love in a stereo
2 headphones and a box
She picks me up, every morning on the walk to school
She ain't worried bout these other little kids
'Cause she told me everyday you sayin' something new
And you always got the illest kicks
Boom Boom tat
And she takes me out, just so the block can see
Told me she wanted the world to know
So she makes me loud now the whole block wants me
But I'm all hers and she's all mine
And even though her parents don't like me inside
Whenever her daddy comes around, we just hide
Cause she doesn't wanna sleep without me that's why
I said
[Chorus: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

[Post-Chorus: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, and she loves my sound, It's why I'm always around
Voted the most popular girl in the class
Cause whenever were together we attract the crowd (Crowd, crowd)
Yeah and she got me down
Touches the right place when I'm fizzling out
And all of her friends love me
Cause at all of the parties, I make em bounce b-bounce
Uh, if I play the right song, she might take it off
Meaning her clothes
You know I love it when she keeps the lights on, play the music soft (Soft)
Yeah, so that's what I do, anything for my boo
But when I hear the knock on the door
I Shhh-shut up, cause I know my cue
But when they gone, I'm back at it
She loves this song, so I blast it
Dad gets home, I hide in the cabinet
Flip my switch like gymnastics
Uh and I'm a always be there for you, you just gotta find my plug
I'll be right here waiting for you in the middle of these speakers
If you ever wanna find my love
So
[Chorus: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

[Post-Chorus: Alex Fitts]
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, and she gets older but I stay the same (Same, same)
And as she grows up, her opinions change
Now shes off at college
Where there's other ones like me
I just hope that one day she'll come back
To hear another song from me
But till then, I just sit in her room and collect dust
Thinkin' about us
Waitin' for the day she'll push my buttons
And I feel her touch and get that rush (Rush, rush)
But I'm not what she needs, so I power down
Then right at that moment where I was found
Hello, her little sister walked in
Knew it was love at first sight
Caught a little twinkle in her eye when I made a sound
She snuck back in the same night
And even though she knows that she wasn't allowed
I know all she wanna do is be near me
One thing is that I felt the same
Wanna tell her but she can't hear me
So, so, I said

Now I know, Now I know, Now I know
Now I know, Now I know, Now I know

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, now is it just me or is this shit crazy?
I mean we still nobodies but damn
Come up from where we from?
Who would’ve thought we’d be this famous?
Critics hate us, promoters played us
Rappers copy what I’ve created
Signed to a major, that ain’t change shit
One year later, bitch I made it
Out the basement, out of all them shitty ass jobs
In the kitchen with the nametag apron
From homeless to a hometown favorite
Broke every stereotype, I got named with
So mother fuck the world with a nase did
So I bust these bars cuz they caged us
Never trust the lords cuz they flagrant
Whips and chains cuz I’ve been affidavit
Suits and ties and courtroom’s for arraignment
Hugs and tears for the jailtime facin'
Pour some beers on the pavement, black rags hangin’
Lettin’ the world know we bangin’
EST is what I’m claimin’
EST is for life baby
Two fingers up till the world lace up
And if you ain’t say it now what the fuck you sayin'?
[Hook]

How can you judge someone you’ve never known?
Speak on where they're from and you've never gone
Man I did dirt in this city,gave birth in this city
How the fuck can I not call this home?
I did my best work in this city
Seen some of the best get merked in this city
And although I love it's crap in a bucket
Gotta keep heat like sweatshirts up in this city
Because it’s a cold world when you hot shit
People keep sayin’ you changed even though you the same
But now you just got shit
But I can do without the fame
Because it was fuck you then they loved you
And everyone want pictures of you
Then family members start thinkin’ you paid and
All of a sudden this faker' your uncle
Radio stations want somethin' for nothing
The bloggers let politics get to their head
I’m one of the best, but they part of the trend
It’s not how you flow with your clothes instead
Man I am a prodigy, fuck an apology
I am who I am accepted or not
I throw my L up cuz even when I'm down
These two fingers right here is all that I got

I’m a Star,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,3170,"""If you feel like I feel then you know that gravity only limit the star but so much and we took this to the top from the bottom""

[Verse 1]
Hold up
Back for the last time
That'll be the last time I'm saying it's the last time
And I'm serious this round
I'm holdin' myself down and I keep it poppin' off like land mine
Yeah, we to the sky like NASA
Send me in the stars so lets hit them with a mascot
Saying I'm speaking in tongues but I give em fast rhyme
Never plan on slowing down when you living the fast life
Because I'mma rip-rap star and I'm the mother mother made man
Out of the south of the bottom Mexican sand tan
And we a team so everybody throw your hands in
Who would of thought Hollywood was where we'd land in AMEN!

[Chorus]
Everybody know I'm that kid they wanna be me man
Gotta stay from them shades the grey
Make sure they see me man
I gotta keep on breathing man
I gotta keep succeeding man
Gotta put that city boy from Cleveland on the city map
Cause I'mma star now everybody in the world wants to know my name and
I'mma represent the city from which I came
So if you feel me throw your drinks in the air
We got them like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah cause I'mma star!
[Verse 2]
You can check my room MESS!
Symbolic tattoos Yes!
Number one on the ruthless
Live life without the move check
School days I failed test
Skinny boy check my frill chest
Even throughout my antics Kells' hell's best Hell Yes!
I'm on my roll to perdition
Baby you know the deal
Spill out a dragon out on the sidewalk keeping it tradition here
I'm calling all the shots so they call me the animator
The youngest hustler of the year, (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Everybody know I'm that kid they wanna be me man
Gotta stay from them shades the grey
Make sure they see me man
I gotta keep on breathing man
I gotta keep succeeding man

Cause I'mma star now everybody in the world wants to know my name and
I'mma represent the city from which I came
So if you feel me throw your drinks in the air
We got them like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah cause I'mma star!
[Verse 3]
We took it to the top from the bottom
I target it, I got'em
They said with my stardom, y'all would tear me down like Sodom
Competition, parted
See y'all in visitors parking
You paid for this event while I headline it like Marvin
Yawning, all of these rappers ain't rapping
They talking three quarters caught 'em just flapping their jaws in
Half of these rapping keeps talking about white
The slows right through my soul in
But I never through the gave all in
Hotter than a summer down in New Orleans
I'm the big bang in the second millennium
Somebody better go tell'em I'm the star
BLAHHHHH!

Anybodys Anthem,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,2640,"[Intro]
Mr. Baker, you've been in here 3 times this week already
What are you doing?
You need to shape up, wait, what are you doing?
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
Come back!
Aye man, y'all gotta calm down out there, you know what I'm saying
It is the Kid, man MGK definitely is in the building but [?]
Hey, I just wanna say, all my people that are going through it right now
Keep your head up baby

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
So this is for the kid
Who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream
Got music to close your eyes to
Let the top down
This is the song that you ride to
Type of feeling
That you just happy to be alive to
You never count it out
So when you down and out
Get up and stand up
Everybody got an anthem now
Y'all got an anthem now
Y'all got your anthem now
Attention people of the world we got an anthem now
[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
This is my pursuit of happiness
Come and ride with me
It's a beautiful day
Somebody feel alive with me
Y'all wanna know what hard is
Somebody reach inside of it
It be the ones that don't say none of that
Got the biggest size in them
I was that lame kid, that sixth grade kid
Back of the class, looked like a nerd
But not the biggest brain kid
But it was that same kid
That made the game flip
Man of the city
Now everybody know the name kid
Where are my sleepers at
I mean my dreamers at
Cause I use to dream
About this moment in my sleeping bag
Look where I'm speaking at
Imagine eating at Italian shops in Italy
Like where my Visa at?
Then take another seven forty seven
To the states the same day
Cause success always begins
From the place that them came
Me I'm a city boy
But I'm no different
So everybody from the streets out to the country
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
So this is for the kid
Who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream
Got music to close your eyes to
Let the top down
This is the song that you ride to
Type of feeling
That you just happy to be alive to
You never count it out
So when you down and out
Get up and stand up
Everybody got an anthem now
Y'all got an anthem now
Y'all got your anthem now
Attention people of the world we got an anthem now

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Hold up
My cups is mold up
I've been fighting for this change
My pockets are swolled up
Even when the weathers colder
Convertible folder
Chilly diamond chains in my rings rose golder
My life [?]
Like I'm having a baby now
Had to get a little chilly
Cause my tummy wasn't officially there
But I'm craving now
All that good life Kanye
Was talking I finally figured out
It ain't bout my ends
Its bout my friends family and making out
And if I would've sold my soul
Imagine what I'd be
So what if I ain't the most successful
It was meant to be
I learned to cope with all of these emotions mentally
Express it through my music
My everyday is a symphony
This is for the bird
This is for the block
This is for the nerd
This is for the jock
Shouts out to the real man up
To the [?]
This your shot
You see the target
Go and land on
This your heart
We are the world
And it's your anthem
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
So this is for the kid
Who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream
Got music to close your eyes to
Let the top down
This is the song that you ride to

You never count it out
So when you down and out
Get up and stand up

Y'all got an anthem now
Y'all got your anthem now
Attention people of the world we got an anthem now

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
This moment's classical
You want it magical
Look inside of yourself
Its autobiographical
It's so easy to think
That things are owed to you
But is those same desires
That grow old to you
Just love life
Live good
Take advantage
To any opportunity
You should
And when they say you can't
Go respond and do it
I did the same and
Achieved what no other rapper could
And it don't matter where you from
Its where you headed to
If you rather than what they said before
Its what I'm telling you
Half of these people
Don't want to see you get a damn thing
Wanna pull you out the fast lane
And park you handicap mane
From the streets to the crib
From the beach to the bridge
From the hood to the coldest [?]
[?]
Don't let them hold you back
I spark the anthem and
Gave you the flame, burn with it
I'm on the top
You want me down
You better come with it

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
So this is for the kid
Who don't got inspiration to vibe to
When you wanna dream
Got music to close your eyes to

[Verse 1]
KELLS! I run this bitch (so what?)
Walk every stripper I don't give two fucks (fucks)
I done give the city everything except my two nuts (ha)
UGH making it rain until the floor's wet (phew)
Reputation keeping all these haters off my door step (fuck outta here)
Half of my city mad (so what)
Half of my city ridin'
Half of my city hate cause half of my city lyin'
They know they feel the kid supporting undercover
Scared to be down after I show the world my skin color
But the motherfuckers know what I do doe
You don't want any beef from me you not a fool dog (nope)
If it ain't about the money then I'm cool ya'll, any rappers knows I'm better than you all (you know what it is)
From the state where the kids get dumb high
Break it down and roll it up with alumni
Where the cops on me about to come by (what?)
Let 'em know we coming straight out BUCKEYES (Ohio waddup!)
And what they thought they got me all fucked, hit every campus in the state and get us all something (july?)
Got high on high street, shot gunned at O-State (oh)
Miami mommy's brought that white and ate the whole cake (i love ya'll!)
And down in Kent they got it poppin' with the Smirnoff's
Started with some twerk then it ended with the shirts off (damn!)
It's natti light and natti please believe they get it crackin' (yes)
And I love my diamonds so I call my A D pi's in Akron (waddup!)
Then catch the frats in action they make sure that my music bump (ugh)
At the party took it to the back with a bitch with a mouth like Donald Duck (you know what that means)
And they call me Donald Trump Mr. O-H-I-O took your misses and now you just Mr. I-hate-my-ho (lame)
You've seen them facebook pictures blowin' the whole team (ha!)
But you know the rules there's no cuffing down in bowling green
My downed Dayton apples stuffed and snuffed ahold of these roll it up puff puff and blows for me wanna fuck get (caugh caugh) the ones (da fuck?) who wants a zone for free
Six hour drive so I wanna feel that in my lungs now (yes!)
The whole 28 grams of kush it lasted me to youngstown (y-o waddup!)
Y-o to Springfield then Wittenberg to Athens express 6 pressin 6 press that god got me high as athen
Toledo put it down never forgot that story, we had the r-a's butt naked in the dormitory (stupid yo)
This is the state we live in (UH!) so squash that hate you spittin' (UH!!)
Double-o hi good riddance BITCHES!
If you know like I know (huh?) homie lie low, so what that mean? Stay the FUCK OUT OF OHIO (ooh)

But we high though if I want it I know...KELLS! I STILL GET IT IN OHIO!

Started From The Bottom Freestyle,rap,machine gun kelly,2013,29589,"[Intro]
Still in the basement, where it started

[Verse 1]
Started from the bottom, now we here
Courtside, you would think I was a Cleveland Cavalier
I’m talking 30,000 feet up in the air
In Dan's lair, 30 minutes later all the fans cheer, bitch
You ain’t seen this power since LeBron
I went to vegas for my 22nd, rented out the Palms
Now they say illuminati is the cause
Or maybe everyone of y’all is lazy and I worked hard
I ain’t never bowing down for a dollar
Selling my soul to a charter
I wouldn’t even take a buck from my father
But they weren't saying that back in the day
When I was hustling tickets to my shows, ask dante
And I heard tempers heating up like a filet
Talking 'bout they run my city when they livin in LA
Sucker, I ain’t hearin nothing bout a word
Talked about it, been about it, bitch I got what I deserved
See I don’t know why everybody mad
You had your chance and you blew it
Meanwhile, I’m young and I’m ruthless
Meanwhile, the dumb are influenced
Thinking you live like the music
Don’t be foolish
My shooters make your face maroon like the Hoosiers (Braahh)
Suckers always wanna talk funny
Broke motherfuckers never wanna talk money
And since I was being quiet in the past
I’m on the top looking down, kiss my ass
Still in the game with my same clique
Still with the hood bitches fuck Cambridge
And when they wanna know if I’m real
I say ""Bitch I ran my city 'fore I ever had a deal""
Kells

Like That,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,4972,"[Verse 1]
Kells, yeah!
I'm cold shit, stepping out the freezer
The people love my Dougie, my denim bluer than Skeeter
Tatted under the beater, I'm spotted up like a cheetah
Look like Leave It to Beaver, liquored up by the liter
Freshest freshman on campus, no notebooks in the bag
Blinding me with the cameras, never look at the tags
Body look like a canvas, skin is covered with tats
And the Chucks are always the classics
Look like I'm in the past, yeah
And I stay B-Boy'd up
Neighbors in my business, make me wanna turn the noise up
Always been a kid, bet I go and get my toys up
Transformer tatted on my arm like the toys, yup
Holler at me prime time, anytime's my time
Every day's grind time, every night's shine time
No chain needed, I am just a star
Forever in your life like a scar
What's up, girls?
Understand I am better than your man
So whatever is the plans, I look better in your pants
And bet I'm on the level with Peter Pan
Eyes chinky like I grew up in Japan
Wasabi
[Chorus]
Yeah, you know how I'm feelin'
Relo in a dub sack, you know how I'm chillin' (Uhh)
Man, I do it like that, all black in the back
Yeah, I'm coolin' like that
Like that, like that
Like that, like that, like that

Like that, like that
Like that, like that, like that

I'm back, back, rocking like Jack Black
Jumping 'round the room like a hack sack
One me, four hoes, three tats, I'm so abstract
You can be futuristic and I'll be past that
Funny 'cause I don't think they get it
And MTV could never see how I'm living
'Cause I don't got a crib, I got a car that I live in
Every day different city, four seats, eight women
I'm from the city where the terminal
Towers over the top of the train tracks
Bring it back ASAP
The hood chicks love me, I keep a Heights girl
And Becky got a Benz, shout out to my white girl
Orange drink in my cup
Fresh Prince in my XBox
Kush in my blunt
So go and get your friends 'cause tonight we up
Three olives and pickle
Let's get fucked up
[Chorus]
Yeah, you know how I'm feelin'
Relo in a dub sack, you know how I'm chillin' (Uhh)
Man, I do it like that, all black in the back
Yeah, I'm coolin' like that

Tim Westwood TV 2012 Freestyle,rap,machine gun kelly,2012,16897,"[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Please welcome the underground champion of the world
He goes by the name MGK, and his flow is timeless
Uh, I let it breathe a lil bit
Y'all have been sleeping on me so long
I let you get a couple more Zs

[Verse]
Fuck it! Look
It goes K -E double L-S straight from H-E double L-S
In the same league with a double VS
Tim West, can I talk my shit?
Hold up, It goes C to the izz-L, E all Dizz-ay...
This is for my people that's working for low pizz-ay
Birthin' 'em in the hood where they jerking 'em
This is dirt cheap living, that's why we're selling soap
Tell them come and get it
Politicians are gimmicks, Obama didn't do shizz-it
Mitt Romney can suck a dizz-ick
You know how the fuck I spit it
You got a problem then spill it
Matter of fact you like Ben Stiller
There's Something About Mary, and when you get balls, zip it!
I speak on what I'm living
I'm my city's mortician
I kill any resident to bring my dreams to fruition
Speaking of fruit, I'm in Heaven
Mixing OG with lemon
On my reverend I was on my airport twenty saggin' my denim
Taking 747's to the UK like Lennon
Tell them to pre-order my album, that shit probably selling
And they're probably yellin', and I probably tellin' you
If you heard a hater get cracked, it was probably his melon
Uh, and if there's smoke, then I'm probably inhalin'
I'm a rock star, they're looking like that's probably Van Halen
Now who's best? Him yes, Tim West
Spin this, back 50 times like Olympian gymnast
Boy I'm a G, I make the queen my mistress
With rhymes so dope, that I failed my piss test
(Uh, hold up, I don't think they got it, lemme reiterate
Tim West, I said, I said)
Who's best? Him yes, Tim West
Spin this, back 50 times like Olympian gymnast
Boy, I'm a G, I make the queen my mistress
And my rhymes so dope, that I failed my piss test
And this just strictly from my teenage mistfits
From low class districts of which I've witnessed
Now here's my wish list: Rolex, Benzes, bottles, bitches
Haters, dismissed!
Uh, uh, now before, alright!
Before we ever do this shit
I'mma just tell that Eminem murdered this shit
Ten times better than a mother fucker like me could ever murder it
But I'mma just pick it as it's knees, mother fucker
And make it hard for him to walk
You know what I'm saying? So fuck it! Look, look!
Watch as I claim my position on this road to perdition
Envisioning my revisions during this brief intermission
Just let it breathe
Uh, my introduction to this game is essential
Never exaggerated publicly, I'm stretching the mental
Keeping it simple, why stop? Let me move with the tempo
Experience the innuendos coming out of my dental
I'm a politician with a beautiful vision
I see my opening, let me make the incision
I'm the newest addition
M-G killa killa Kells
I rock wells spitting that fire from a living hell
Tell me who's real.. Cleveland, what's up?
Cleveland, what's up?...Lace up, check
Now people fear what they don't understand
Well my community comprehends grams, uh
We do what we can, picturing a better living so I'm driven like Benz
Live, learn and keep growing, that's the theory of man
Expose my flows, poetry flowing uncontrollably
I'm the positive exterior while y'all is just a ho in me
Hopefully what? No, I kill with my songs
My weapon of choice is my voice, so I'm strap 'til I'm gone
And I'm gone, Kells
I got more bars than a jail
I got more heat than the sun itself
You would think i was a member of hell
You would think I didn't have any manners
The way I use this beat for myself
And if anyone of you got a problem then lemme call Tim West on the cell and we'll tell you
Kells is the man with the plan
With like one, two iron rings on his hand
And this is for the fans in the stands
That held me down from the start, bitch, and this the end!",en,"ladies and gentlemen please welcome the underground champion of the world he goes by the name mgk , and his flow is timeless uh , i let it breathe a lil bit y'all have been sleeping on me so long i let you get a couple more zs  fuck it ! look it goes k -e double l-s straight from h-e double l-s in the same league with a double vs tim west , can i talk my shit ?

Ain't nobody left for us man, shit

Hey yo, it's lonely at the top
Hey yo Kells, hey yo Kells are you ready?
Hey yo Kells, get these motherfuckers
Ahh!

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
All of y'all better wake up now
Everyone's a little late right now
Keep it real, I'm a little hot
How the fuck you gonna hate right now?
Remember my first single?
Chyea well it's doing great right now
Took a five hundred thou out the gate
Straight to the bank right now
Shit gets wicked in my city so I got a semi in a race right now
Everybody fuckin' with me and if you ain't then you outta place right now
Everybody ain't real, everybody can't be us
Everybody stay losin', that makes us champions
I take that title, 'til they wave like tidal
Introducin' me to Billie Jean, shit I'll take that Michael
Tryin' bring the paper in, my paper thin like that Bible
That is how you win, stackin' Benjamins 'til it's big as the Eiffel
Uh
[Hook]
We are the champions my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions of the world

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I came straight from sellin' nickel bags
Out my baby mama pad just to get a meal
Straight from puttin' Similac in a Walmart bag tryin' make a steal
Straight from burnin' 1 thousand CDs with my name on it
Opposite of what the game wanted, muhfucka we just tryin' get a mill
Now the Shaker grad boy signed to the Bad Boy
But I ain't gettin cheesecake, no this ain't Making of the Band homeboy
What is that my bitch? God damn she Colombian homeboy?
Ever since I got some bands homeboy, haters tryin' be my friends homeboy
Pull up in that tour bus everybody know what's going on in there
Backroom lotta panties droppin', lotta pretty bitches, pretty long hair
I'ma talk my shit, bitch I came into the game as rookie of the year
Blake Griffin, Kyrie, (who you talkin' 'bout?) Amar'e Stoudemire
Yeah and still couple people gotta problem with me at hater magazine
I mean Fader magazine, tell the journalist to suck what's in my saggin' jeans
Choke muhfucka, choke, none of my fans opened up your fuckin' magazine
Lucky I don't have Jermaine come up in your office and load up a fuckin'' magazine
Charlemagne don't like me, what's his name won't fight me
I'm a hype individual, God damn it, hypebeats hype me
Maybe cause I wasn't a good kid in a mad city like Kendrick
I was just a little bad motherfucker beggin landlords to be tenant
Beggin everyone to give my song a listen, tryin' get up out a shitty job position
Tryin' get a 24 karat gold toilet, 'cause I never had a pot to piss in
But it's ok I'm still maintaining
No, no, no
No fuck that, fuck maintaining
I'm tired of being humble
It time to let these industry muhfuckas know, man
I wake up and I see four MTV awards on my dresser that I got this year
I'm rollin' up Js as long as my fucking shoe on a gold plaque
Lace the fuck up!







[Outro: Diddy]
Champions! Bad Boy!
Lace Up! Black Flag!
Never, never, never give up
We see you at the top, baby
We will be waiting there with a ice cold glass of lemonade and Cîroc
And a couple of bad bitches to massage your feet, cause that's how we do
If you make it, you're welcome

What It Seems,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,5314,"[Intro: Dub-O]
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems

[Chorus: Dub-O]
They ask why I do not come round, come round
Cause I'll be grindin till the sun down, sun down
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
No, I'm just chasing after my dreams ya'll, I got no friends
Im strung out, strung out so high, I need to come down, come down, come down
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
No, I'm just chasing after my dreams, yo
This my world above the earth surface
Where the grass is somehow greener and weathers always perfect
Questionable lifestyle, but they don't know for certain
That we just don’t give a fuck, cause we condone cursing
I wanna get that dream and live my life
With no Rihanna, no T.I.,I'm just living for today
No tomorrow, no pause, no comma, real shit, no persona
I'm enjoying every pussy like a virgin or Madonna
And I took it from the basement, yeah
All the way to first place and I'm feeling good
Need a somebody to save me from the cavemen running my neighborhood
Now I never wanna come back, I don't wanna touch, smell or feel the crowd
I just wanna live with my alter ego in my world
Well it feels like the world is spinning round, and angels asking if I'll be coming down
But I don't know if I wanna do that, because up on this planet is where I grew at
[Chorus: Dub-O]
They ask why I do not come round, come round
Cause I'll be grindin till the sun down, sun down
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
No, I'm just chasing after my dreams ya'll, I got no friends
Im strung out, strung out so high, I need to come down, come down, come down
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
No, I'm just chasing after my dreams ya'll

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
My flow powers infinite, with the clouds showers infamy
Cowards devour instantly on every hour literally
But this is our symphony, and when you know it's time to end with me
Just make sure that when I'm gone my child lives for me
And if we blow let's talk in show, take another way up there
I'm a man of many moves so in space I'm prepared
Landed in a plane I bust shit I'm already from here
So when I'm classified as alien I don't care
Peace out to the citizens I'm gone
Let the other [?] and know I'm home
ET from the CLE believe my adrenaline is ready for the long haul
It's slowly up and out of space get me out of here
Cause when I'm grounded everyone the same every where
Which is why I must be foreign wit it why? cause it's like most these rappes boring in it So what you saying?
So to keep everybody from snoring in it, I'm a heal the game put neosporin in it
[Chorus: Dub-O]
They ask why I do not come round, come round
Cause I'll be grindin till the sun down, sun down
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
No, I'm just chasing after my dreams ya'll, I got no friends
Im strung out, strung out so high, I need to come down, come down, come down
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems

[Chorus: Dub-O]
They ask why I do not come round, come round
Cause I'll be grindin till the sun down, sun down
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
No, I'm just chasing after my dreams ya'll, I got no friends
Im strung out, strung out so high, I need to come down, come down, come down
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Do what you do man, fuck everybody else, you know?
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
No, I'm just chasing after my dreams ya'll
So high, I need to come down, come down, come down

A Million And One Answers,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,5947,"[Intro]
You know, it's funny
It's like, when I {*record scratch*} on somebody
Everybody felt like I owed them answers to everything
But it's cool
This how MGK handles the situation
Haha

[Verse 1]
They be saying ""Kells why you leaving now?
You bounced and never came back around""

Look I'm still in the city I just don't leave the house

""Well what's this talk about you acting all crazy?
They say you getting Hollywood""

Shit, fuck them, pay me

""I'm saying, you won't even collab with another artist?""
Wrong, it's just that half of these rappers out here retarded
There's only 2 reasons why I wouldn't do a song
Either it isn't beneficial or that money isn't long

""Damn, it's like that?""

Unfortunately it is
Cause no cheddar equals out to no food for my kid

""Hold up, you got a kid too? How old is you?""

I'm 19 but I deal with grown man issues

""Okay cool, at least we know you not no fool
But you look like a college boy, why you not in the school?""

Cause I was in the principal's offices more than the class
Wouldn't write a letter of recommendation for my ass
See most of the teachers hate me, right along with the kids
Cause my reputation outside of the campus was getting big
Biatch
Haha, yeah it's like that

""Oh it's like that?
Okay okay, but I ain't done brah""
[Verse 2]
""Okay, you're confusing me
I always see you in the hood
But you look like them white boys from Laguna beach
So what are you? A Thug or an 'Asher Roth'?""

Look, I'm none of that, I'm the whole entire catalogue
From front to back the perfect blend like camouflage
Because I'm still me, even when the camera's off

""Well I been hearing about some things
You false bragging where you from?
So what city is it? Help me understand this, son""

Look I was born in H-town, raised in the middle east
Seen every part of the world from the ghetto to the beach
But unfortunately that was all before I turned 9
So the experience wasn't appreciated by my young mind

""Yeah get to the point""

Chill brah, let me talk

""Well explain the two area codes thats tatted on your arms""

Okay my left one is for Denver and my right is for The Land
Better known as Cleveland, Midwest is what I am
Next time you wanna question, understand this fam
I represent cause those the cities that taught me to be a man
""Okay, I guess I didn't see everything on the plate""

Well next time you wanna question get your facts straight
Biatch

[Verse 3]

""Damn
I guess that was cool and all, I dig that
But you not off the chain yet homeboy""

Oh yeah? You got some more?
Aight, come on brah
Let's go

""So what you got besides your name that makes you think you so cool?""

I won first at the Apolo, what more do I gotta prove?
The first rapper to do it
Plus on top of that, I'm staring at my '09
Best live performance award plaque

""Yeah, well how many fans you got?""

Thousands

""Prove it""

I'm on every major blog with no album

""Sure, but anyone with a deal gets that respect""

Wrong, cause I did this without a major label check

""so you saying you not signed?""

No, I had no help
I earned everything that I got then I signed myself

""Damn, you must be ballin', wheres the chains and the whip?""

I'm far from rich and the only jewels that I cop's for my chick

""What about your boys?
How'd you get them all to be down?
How much you pay?""

None dude, we from the same side of town
And if win, split up the chips and for the moment live good
But if not, we still fam like we back in the hood

""Friends? I respect that
What about the haters?
Word is you got a couple cats jacking your flavor""

Hell yeah, a couple people out to down my name
Turn on the radio the songs and the style's the same
Befriended me to stab me in the back, they lame
Should be ashamed, but all is well
It's just the rules of the game
Man
Haha yeah, wow its crazy

""That definitely was crazy man
'Preciate you answering the questions though man
Clearing it all out
You gotta tell 'em your name tho
Go ahead""

Okay I got you bro
Let it be known
That you have been speaking with

Skate Cans,rap,machine gun kelly,2013,30409,"[Verse 1]
Original chucks on laced up like I'm taking them on a run
They're begging me not to kill it I tell them I'm having fun
They're asking me how I do it I tell them get on the rail
Meaning get on﻿ your grind I'm ready now what's the deal
My size 11s skate on the surface like hovercrafts
A superhero you think that I was a Thundercat
I run with villains my village calling me son of Sam
Simply cause when I come around they st-st-st-stuttering
My body's tatted they say I look like graffiti
That's why I be on the roll these regulars try to read me
The way that people be staring you'd think that I was a TV
But when it comes to the haters I cannot see them like Stevie
But I be seeing repeats of dead rappers like 6th sense
My competition ain't worth nothing like 6 cents
Misfit I swear I'm sick shit you'd think I was Ryan Sheckler by the way I make the kicks flip
Too cool hands shakes and dap serving all of these fools like pancakes and snacks
Whoever thought that I wouldn’t be damaging the tracks
Was pulling they own legs like hamstrings and calves

[Hook]
I am the only great white
Body look like a canvas skin is covered with tats and my chucks are always the classics look like I'm in the past
Turn the noise up
100 words and running
Turn the noise up
What'd I tell these people
Turn the noise up
Transformer tatted on my arm like a droid, YUP!
I am the only great white
Anytime's my time everyday is grind time no chain needed I am just a star Kells
Turn the noise up
100 words and running turn the noise up
What'd I tell these people
Turn the noise up
Best rapper alive who? Kells, Kells
[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm so beyond my time the Michael Angelo of the second millenium
I roll it up and get higher than condominiums
My rap's braille the way the people be feelin' 'em
Midwest all the way to the other side of the﻿ Meridian
Back back EST is in the spot now
We be the crew all of these fools try to jock now
The type of dudes that'll make ya mouth drop down
Faces looking twisted like we guzzlin' Ciroc down
We're just city slickers in search of them bigger figures
This is more than a game my business isn't a scrimmage
And I be with the sickest cause I'm trying to be the illest with them Die Hard fans like Bruce Willis
Pow pow
I'm in the cut like alcohol in the wound
But I'm tripping like I popped Adderall on the moon
Focused on killing tracks like I'm rapping them from the tomb
R.I.P. to this instrumental lighters up for the tunes
Every morning I wake up and put my fitted on
Which means every day I wake and put my city on
Cleveland we ready just turn the MIDI on
Kid Kells, feeling like a million gone

Clutched to the blunt roach
Taking it to the head with one toke
If only my problems could be solved with one smoke
And is the economy so messed up?
I already know I'm not gonna get the job
So what's the point in gettin' dressed up?
And I done seen my share
Fresh outta high school, lost two of mine out there
That's why [?] think twice
People that said ""them Hollywood acts come around here""
This the Concrete Jungle, constant trouble
Always high but never humble
Livin' out this cartoon but we surrounded by rocks like Barney Rubble
Gangs and violence, pimps and hoes
Crack, wet, brick, zones
Jackers, rappers, trappers, bums
Block, 'jects, 'burbs, slums
Chopper, Glock, Mac, Uzi
This real, that's movie
Fights, cops, snitch, fans
This is midwest
Been around the world, seen a lot of things
Seem like I'm attached to the ghetto like a wedding ring
Never didn't like her, never did wife her (No)
'Til she got me 0-1 in the circle like a cypher
Oh my god, please applaud
I ain't going home BITCH I go hard
Only white boy with a style so raw
Real recognize me, not you, you suck (Yuh)
[Chorus]
Tell me who gon' ride until the midwest rise
Who's heart's gonna stop when the midwest dies
Who's gonna take the spark from out these midwest eyes
And believe I ain't gon' stop until the midwest mine",en,"uh , uh what up ? kells cleveland , ha ah  what up ? hey how we roll ?  out the middle of the map we be givin it from the top and we're done with the bottom of the class - what we call home everybody wanna know if the kid got a story old folks gimme just a little when i give more started out with a smidgen of a midget now tell me where my competition ? givin' 'em all , givin' 'em all , givin' 'em all , the shots  subliminals and criminals we don't get caught !  tell me who gon' ride until the midwest rise who's heart's gonna stop when the midwest dies who's gonna take the spark from out these midwest eyes and believe i ain't gon' stop until the midwest mine  yeah , yeah , everybody wanna hear the fast flow comin' out the c-l-e-v-e-l-a-n-d you better be rippin' the track though you better be bounce like , you better be  if your word twisted like strings of a lasso  take it to the top of the terminal til' my last chance they can't determine now why there ain't no stopping now we breaking out through all the cracks of the cowers cause benny showers in the pockets of my eddie bauers' i-i am that , kid that be sitting on the front porch clutched to the blunt roach taking it to the head with one toke if only my problems could be solved with one smoke and is the economy so messed up ? i already know i'm not gonna get the job so what's the point in gettin' dressed up ? and i done seen my share fresh outta high school , lost two of mine out there that's why  think twice people that said ""them hollywood acts come around here"" this the concrete jungle , constant trouble always high but never humble livin' out this cartoon but we surrounded by rocks like barney rubble gangs and violence , pimps and hoes crack , wet , brick , zones jackers , rappers , trappers , bums block , 'jects , 'burbs , slums chopper , glock , mac , uzi this real , that's movie fights , cops , snitch , fans this is midwest been around the world , seen a lot of things seem like i'm attached to the ghetto like a wedding ring never didn't like her , never did wife her  'til she got me 0-1 in the circle like a cypher oh my god , please applaud i ain't going home bitch i go hard only white boy with a style so raw real recognize me , not you , you suck   tell me who gon' ride until the midwest rise who's heart's gonna stop when the midwest dies who's gonna take the spark from out these midwest eyes and believe i ain't gon' stop until the midwest mine","['uh', 'uh', 'kells', 'cleveland', 'ha', 'ah', 'hey', 'roll', 'middle', 'map', 'givin', 'class', 'home', 'everybody', 'wanna', 'know', 'kid', 'got', 'story', 'old', 'folks', 'gimme', 'little', 'started', 'smidgen', 'midget', 'tell', 'competition', 'givin', 'givin', 'givin', 'shots', 'subliminals', 'criminals', 'caught', 'tell', 'gon', 'ride', 'midwest', 'rise', 'heart', 'gon', 'na', 'stop', 'midwest', 'dies', 'gon', 'na', 'spark', 'midwest', 'eyes', 'believe', 'ai', 'gon', 'stop', 'midwest', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'everybody', 'wanna', 'hear', 'fast', 'flow', 'comin', 'c', 'l', 'e', 'v', 'e', 'l', 'n', 'd', 'better', 'rippin', 'track', 'better', 'bounce', 'like', 'better', 'word', 'twisted', 'like', 'strings', 'lasso', 'terminal', 'til', 'chance', 'determine', 'ai', 'stopping', 'breaking', 'cracks', 'cowers', 'cause', 'benny', 'showers', 'pockets', 'eddie', 'bauers', 'kid', 'sitting', 'porch', 'clutched', 'blunt', 'roach', 'taking', 'head', 'toke', 'problems', 'solved', 'smoke', 'economy', 'messed', 'know', 'gon', 'na', 'job', 'point', 'gettin', 'dressed', 'seen', 'share', 'fresh', 'outta', 'high', 'school', 'lost', 'think', 'twice', 'people', 'said', 'hollywood', 'acts', 'come', 'concrete', 'jungle', 'constant', 'trouble', 'high', 'humble', 'livin', 'cartoon', 'surrounded', 'rocks', 'like', 'barney', 'rubble', 'gangs', 'violence', 'pimps', 'hoes', 'crack', 'wet', 'brick', 'zones', 'jackers', 'rappers', 'trappers', 'bums', 'block', 'jects', 'burbs', 'slums', 'chopper', 'glock', 'mac', 'uzi', 'real', 'movie', 'fights', 'cops', 'snitch', 'fans', 'midwest', 'world', 'seen', 'lot', 'things', 'like', 'attached', 'ghetto', 'like', 'wedding', 'ring', 'like', 'wife', 'til', 'got', 'circle', 'like', 'cypher', 'oh', 'god', 'applaud', 'ai', 'going', 'home', 'bitch', 'hard', 'white', 'boy', 'style', 'raw', 'real', 'recognize', 'suck', 'tell', 'gon', 'ride', 'midwest', 'rise', 'heart', 'gon', 'na', 'stop', 'midwest', 'dies', 'gon', 'na', 'spark', 'midwest', 'eyes', 'believe', 'ai', 'gon', 'stop', 'midwest']",3,Nightlife & Rebellion
In the Car Freestyle,rap,machine gun kelly,2013,7601,"[Verse 1: MGK]
Yea Cleveland on my back uh
L's up when they see me
Came from the underground now they on t.v
Swear to god ha
Ooh Machine Gun Kells, dub-o
Look look you can miss me with that rap shit
You can miss me with that stereotypical ""he isn't lyrical""
Barbershop chat shit
Miss me with that frat shit
Only university i graduated
Was hard Knox
I'm from  Cleveland
Where they trap shit
Five bucks for the catfish
Five bucks for the  bad bitch
Five bucks in a drought in this city could get ya piece of that cactus
With saran wrap for the wrapping
Whatchu mean?
Meaning we bundling all of this loud into Garcia Vegas
I swear its contagious the way that we passed it
Patches on my denim vest
About as old as my dad is
Blood stains on my chucks
Cause well you know what that is
Jet lag from these long flights
Still sitting coach like its practice
Feeling like students when the schools back I’m trying to see what first class is
Cash is the root of all evil
But maybe that why i do bad shit
Fact is i do what we need cause the country
And no Catholic or Baptist
Warlord or pacifist,could've seen what I seen without
IMAX's and 3D glasses
Yall in family houses like Bob Saget
Both parents i was on family couches
Like you don't want it i'll wear it
Inheriting hammy downs as a grown man embarrassed but
These dreams seemed far fetched
When reality is you’re sharing a shirt
And a shower, and shitter while your newborns in the carriage
Packaging groceries in bags for an hourly seven dollar average
This ain't living this is strife
This is Hennessy and this is just sprite
But Maybe one day they'll remember me like they remember Mike
When I'm gone
Mother fucker, god dammit ""that's what I'm talking about
Maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
""what else?""
I ain't done
Look when my times up on this earth
And they bury me in that dirt
Don't say that i ain't milk this life
For everything that it's worth
{yuhck}
For everything that its worth
And when i die remember me like Kurt
..BANG!
[Verse 2: Dub-O]
Look they said Dub quit with that humble shit
You can only be cool for so long
But don't misjudge I'm not
The one you wanna rumble with
Write it down take a pic
Do what ever you have to do to remember me
I'm in your memory for infinity
And the same goes for your bitch
Remember me from Kennedy
Or east high on the east side
Were them niggas die over anything
Yeah, dub-o
Oh you ain't know
I got go i rock shows
And i'll be calling plays like flaco
But I'm so Cleveland
It's a damn shame
And est is my damn game
I've been reppin that
Since way back
And that double x is my campaign
Pop bottles that champagne
Its Cliquot for the champions
Now where the hell is my damn ring?
Biatch, celebration for nothing let you believe what you see
I’m in the back but no frontin
Seven days out the week i be working
I'm full of hunger
That jealousy is the smell of defeat
And remember who told ya
I'm gone ""motherfucker""
Just remember me when I'm gone
Dub-o eh
When that times up on my watch
And they bury me in that box
Don't say i ain't give my gang
Everything that i got ""real shit"" yea
Everything that i got
And when i die remember me
Like PAC BABAYY
""Est mother fucker""
"" lACE UP MOTHER FUCKER""
BLACK FLAG MoTHER FUCKER""",en,"yea cleveland on my back uh l's up when they see me came from the underground now they on t . v swear to god ha ooh machine gun kells , dub-o look look you can miss me with that rap shit you can miss me with that stereotypical ""he isn't lyrical"" barbershop chat shit miss me with that frat shit only university i graduated was hard knox i'm from cleveland where they trap shit five bucks for the catfish five bucks for the bad bitch five bucks in a drought in this city could get ya piece of that cactus with saran wrap for the wrapping whatchu mean ? meaning we bundling all of this loud into garcia vegas i swear its contagious the way that we passed it patches on my denim vest about as old as my dad is blood stains on my chucks cause well you know what that is jet lag from these long flights still sitting coach like its practice feeling like students when the schools back i’m trying to see what first class is cash is the root of all evil but maybe that why i do bad shit fact is i do what we need cause the country and no catholic or baptist warlord or pacifist , could've seen what i seen without imax's and 3d glasses yall in family houses like bob saget both parents i was on family couches like you don't want it i'll wear it inheriting hammy downs as a grown man embarrassed but these dreams seemed far fetched when reality is you’re sharing a shirt and a shower , and shitter while your newborns in the carriage packaging groceries in bags for an hourly seven dollar average this ain't living this is strife this is hennessy and this is just sprite but maybe one day they'll remember me like they remember mike when i'm gone mother fucker , god dammit ""that's what i'm talking about maybe they'll remember me when i'm gone ""what else ?

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I be going hard for them pesos
Came from bottom made a milli
Squad move when I say so
Gotta bring them dollars to the city
Mufuckas thought I wasn't living
Daddy thought I never could've did it
Now my hood see that Wahoo fitted on the TV screen next to Diddy
Praise God for my brothers
I'll rob for my brothers
Cause when times was hard I flipped that pack like somersaults for my brothers
And I never ride with them suckers
Dick hard for my bitch
And without me half of these rappers wouldn't exist, shit I be going hard for that...

My taste level on Ace level
Spade nigga for a paid nigga
We darkskinned, south of France
All acting like Jay nigga
Jetski and I'm jetlagged
Still smelling like jet fuel
That PJ split three ways, 60 making that jet move
My pesos from Play Cloths, Pyrex from Pedro
Tags pop from Pucci to Paul Smith to Penrose
Been down, that's ten toes
Score nigga, that's endzone
Ask me I sell dope, N-O from this Benzo

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I'm getting paid when I wake up cause I hustle hard before I go to sleep
And now I got my cake up, I'm balling hard like I'm suppose to be
Got bad bitches tryna roll with me
White bitches like ""totally""
V.S. stones all over me
And I'm killing niggas no first degree
Cause I'm going hard for that peso
Selling blocks no lego
Got killers all on my payroll
And they shoot like O.J. Mayo
In the coupe, pull up like ""hey ho""
With the top down on that bitch
And when they cat scan my body it was dollar signs on that bitch, whoa!

Okay
100 words and Running
Whaddup!

[Verse 1]
Uh
Straight out the fridge with it
Cool as polar bear paw prints in it
Bitch I'm the kid like ""what you talking about Willis?""
Fresh as new room service pillows with the mints in it
Yeah! I guess the dollars make cents in it
Pun intended, mouth nasty, need rinse in it, Euk!
And that's not no incense
When they whisper that my walk got a funky little stench in it (Damn)
Bitch I'm the shit, couldn't miss the smell
Turn around, give a wave, ""Hi, I'm Mr. Kells""
Never flush the toilet, open your nose please
Haters from high school at my shows in the nose bleeds
""Hi, what's up with you fools?""
I dropped out and now I am the new school
Of this rap shit
Million dollar man with a thousand dollar budget
Still my hand on my nuts like fuck it!
Kells
100 Words and Running, hoped you tied your laces tight
Me, I'm in my Chuck-T's with a blunt up, please we blazing right
Cause I couldn't imagine any other way to bring the year in, now light that shit up!
And I couldn't even fathom any other way to bring a beat in that I like so get up!
Fuck these hoes! Fuck these hoes! One more time like ""FUCK THESE HOES!""
I'm rolling off these pebbles and I'm stoned like these country roads
Me, I'm a city boy, it's going down, no Nitti, boy
And if its about money, shout my hitter I'll come get it boy
No twitter boy, but I'll get at these rappers names and shit
Fuck all they fame, they bitch just grabbed my Wii, no games and shit
And now he mad, he angry shit
I tell that fool to ""Pay me, bitch!""
But he don't understand cause he don't speak my lan-gu-age
So uh! On to the next one, we up
A pussy's just a hole, and I'm in the country club
Got seventeen mo', and I hole-in-one them all
Stroke the first time, no birdies, eagles or pars
No major deal, we major still, fuck you thought it was?
Don't need no major to tell me that I got a major buzz
I'm major money, tell these fools ""Kiss my major nuts""
They tell me watch my mouth, but I don't give a major FUCK!
I'm major pain and ain't talking bout no Damon Wayans
Look up in the sky! It's a bird
Nah, that's just me high off that Mary Jane
Yeah bitch, I said ""Mary Jane""
And if I could, I would marry Jane
They be saying ""That white boy can spit!""
I'm like can't he mane...?
Shit and fresh, call me ""Mannie"", mane
Under the mistletoe, let her kiss my candy cane
I'm Danny Zuko with it, but I don't want no Sandy mane
I want them greased the first night like a caddy mane
Fuck what they, fuck what they sayin', I'm on some dumb shit
Wanna menage-a-trois, bring your friends, fuck that one bitch
And rappers saying they don't feel Machine Gun's shit
Well I don't feel your music on some numb shit, Bitch!
Yeah! They kiss my ass while I let the beat build
I'm flying G4 looking down, you on your feet still
Shit, where they do that at my dude?
So many haters like goddamn am I rude?
You value menu motherfuckers!
Couldn't afford the cheese on a burger
So don't call my manager asking for verses
Cause your payment for a line of me cursing
Is enough for me to buy a car and throw some D's on it
Like I tossed Pamela Anderson shirt up (Oh My God!)
Don't know what I gotta do to get through
So I slow it down and rap the rest in a screw (Will that do it?)
Yeah!
Feeling draped out and dripped up
So many bitches I need a pimp cup
Sticky's getting lit up
Skirts need to lift up
Haters not allowed and if they come they getting bit up
Someone put the fence up while we get the trees lit
Blow all of this grass til it's only concrete shit
Do not let your feet slip, all black Chucks on my feet
Dip me down
Tie my laces and now its back to the beat bitch!
Said it's back to the beat bitch
Say it's back to the beat bitch!

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
200 RPM, behind the wheel of my mind's GM
Praying they don't see him
Swerve around the drama from my BM
Wondering why all these people wanna be him
Stuck in the matrix but doesn't want no one to free him
Cause in reality fantasy's all that's left of freedom
And reality's a bitch and that's why I say I don't need'em
Just a substance to keep me sleeping so I can keep on dreaming
Fuck Tylenol PM, someone THC him
Smoke away all my problems, eyes looking like Koreans
You're only here to rap, other ambitions simply keep'em
So I'm clenching down my gums like a baby when his teething
What they saying in my face ain't what they thinking, they deceiving
I'm about to live up to my reputation as a heathen
And put my size 12's into place where they eating
Til it comes out the other end like a mother that's conceiving
Just be glad you breathing
It's summer and my heart is still freezing
Cause back home it is kill or be killed season
So I'm watching my back, bet I'm familiar with treason
People threw me in the lions den alone for no reason
""Fuck em"" if they hear him, but shut up when they see him
While my family wondering why new breads in my ATM
But how can I fit in a cubicle when I'm a coliseum
Just know that no matter where I fit I do it off of Cleveland
And Mile High
Ugh, The Calm

I wrote this on a plane, so high cause the ground is so insane
Spent my life inside a bed because the world is too mundane
Now I'm doing everything I shouldn't to sustain
And muthafuck a 9 to 5, look I will never work that shift again
2/11/2010 is where that story ends
And this ain't science fiction, welcome to this chapter in my life
But it's gone be awhile, please enjoy the flight
Lace Up! Kells!

[Chorus]
And if this wasn't meant to be and all my dreams die in loving memory
You can take me with'em cause I ain't going home and I ain't waking up
Living this dream is all I know
And if they want me dead, they better raise those prices on my head cause I said that I'd be famous
Now look at me, I made it. So when they say name they gone put up me with the greatest

[Verse 2]
And Tony told me that this world was mine
So I took that shit up off the shelf and skipped the line
I ain't payin for what's due. Man, I'm taking what I've earned
They say Kells is on fire, let that muthafucka burn
Tell my team we got next. EST until the muthafuckin death
I am my brothers keeper
I ain't sellin them, not for a check
Cause a buck couldn't make me give a fuck about my brother
Matter fact being broke's what made me love my brother
Yelling East side, East side, mighty, mighty East side and I'll be there for life like 3 strikes
Couldn't take me away for shit but they say this where you'll be killed mufucka
That's fine, just make sure I die a real mufucka

And if this wasn't meant to be and all my dreams die in loving memory
You can take me with'em cause I ain't going home and I ain't waking up

Now look at me, I made it. So when they say name they gone put up me with the greatest

[Bridge]
And if you got a dream, don't be scared to fall. You won't hit the ground, cause we above it all
Tell'em dim the lights, we just wanna shine
So they could see me starred and I could get what's mine
And if you got a dream, don't be scared to fall. You won't hit the ground, cause we above it all
Tell'em dim the lights, we just wanna shine. Praying that tomorrow won't rewind

No mercy has begun
Ladies and gentlemen
Machine Gun Kelly
This kid, I think he is a star
He's one of the best live performers I've ever seen
He's also more importantly a movement

[Verse 1]
Backpack? Fuck that
I was always hanging where the thugs at
I was always hanging with the rugrats
Someone come and show me where the drugs at
Someone come and pop on a hot song, meaning my shit, get an iPhone take a video and make it last long get some popcorn because I murder every single instrumental that I get on
And a muthafucka isn't gonna stop the shit
Until I make an album like a 2pacalypse
Until I'm killing everybody like in Auschwitz
Until I'm revolutionary like a Gandhi is
Until I'm poppin' all these bottles to accomplishments
Until I'm always hot no matter what the climate is
Until whenever somebody is feeling talkative my name is brought up, doesn't matter what the topic is
Didn't think I rap? Bitch I flow like ""boom boom bap""
Bitch I come from where you never moved at
Look into my room get a view, look at my past
God damn
Got weed, got jack, oxy's? Had that
Got Jimi, got Slash, got shrooms, got hash
Bipolar syndrome, kicked in, got mad
Walked on the red carpet like kiss my ass you bitch
(More Sound Clips of Various People talking about MGK)
He was truly the only developed on-point performer on the bill
If you know anything about lyricists, then you know who MGK is
I need a freestyle, I need to hear Machine Gun Kelly spit

[Verse 2]
Fuck that, y'all don't gotta hear shit
Ask anybody in the 216 if my name rings bells in them bricks
""Man everybody know who that is""
What you hate, boy? You late, boy
You ain't heard about that great boy?
3 letter name cacausian boy
Used to live right there up the way, boy
You heard about him, you've said the name
You saw the iTunes and clicked to play
You liked the shit and you bought the shit
Put him on the playlist right next to Jay
Then your girl saw me, I signed her tits
And she disappeared you couldn't find the bitch
Then your heart stopped you know what time it is
I put my dick in her common sense
Fuck boy you lonely
Fuck boy you phony
You would think these fuck boys fucking boys with the way that they be all on me
If it ain't EST in your mouth...then whatever you rep is corny
Got a new single without me on it? That shit's boring, bitch I'm snoring
Man I'm touring every damn day
I showed y'all how to turn up
100 j's in my ashtray bitch I showed y'all how to burn up
I sacrificed what y'all wouldn't give to these kids and now you love fans?
None of these rappers got a movement tell 'em quit jocking my ass
God damn...
And y'all can have the bloggers I don't type shit
God gave me both these hands to fight with
Wassup!?
Now say goodnight quick because my right fist's like Vicodin
Might just throw you on the ground like dices
Might just go into the pocket with your license, get a wallet and a couple dollars, buy nice shit
Dyke bitches all over my dick, that's priceless
I just fuck 'em if they're wet like Pisces
Wives is jealous of the bitch I'm with cause they almost F'd like D-...get it?
Digest every little word I'm spittin' cause it's food for thought so pay attention
Better listen, I’m on a mission to killing off all of my competition and if you are with that then good riddance muthafucka!

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Verse 1]
Kells,
All these pretty lights, 
Can’t you see em?
Endless nights
In my life's museum
Where we see our heroes
And pretend to be em
And we seize the day
Carpe Diem
Previous to this dream state I had leftovers on each plate
Left shoe all tattered up from this long journey my feet ache
Left the life that I lived because everyday was just replays,
And I dreamed big, walked around in my PJ's
And my street days are still here
Never changed like I still wear
The same pair
Phone call? what for?
We ain't long distance, I’m still there
Still on the blocks where gun cocks and gunshots are more familiar of a sound then what’s ""hot""
12 dollar showers at truck stops would give anybody motivation that you must not lose this one shot...

Demon days
Evil nights
Happy hours
Frequent flights,
God flow
People’s strife
Hear it once
Speak it twice
Hearts never break even
And they change color like seasons
Backs turn like treason
But somehow you swear you ain't leaving
Follow me now, follow me now
Spoon fulls of sugar and handfuls of medicine help it go down
Help it go down
I was just a fool in a room full of Edison's, look at me now
Look at me now
Feel my words
Look at this sound
Reminiscin on when I was lookin out on the city wishin a million muthafuckas gave me that crown, bitch I run this town

Ok, I lost my job last night
Picked up my paycheck
But 35% of it's gone already cuz Uncle Sam ain't get paid yet
Mom and them bitchin bout this rent
I ain't even gon' say shit
And half of what is left goes to her
(why?) Cuz I ain't use that latex, damn
Cheese sandwich and chips (meal)
Slim just spilled his drink in my Toyota 96 (wheels)
Well at least that blunt is lit
Don't they say life is what you make it?
Then I’m tryna make it money
And ride through my hood clean as Easter Sunday, that’s wassup, uh

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
One time
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
One time
For the bullshit that you came from
Worked hard to get away from
But the devils there and you just can't seem to shake em
Two times
For them long nights that you stayed up
Thinkin about that paper
Crush it, lick it, split it, light it, blaze up
From the mind of a stoner, from the mind of a stoner
Simple thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner
Just the mind of a stoner, the mind of a stoner
Simpler thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner, oh

Parents aren't doin much now since little brother got locked up
And I’m stuck smokin this mid waiting for the weed man to get stocked up
And my girl cancelled on me, said something else popped up
And I can't get with my ex now cuz her ring finger all rocked up,damn
No one likes you when your 23 without a plan
Sit around in apartments all day smokin weed and I’m like
""bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe""
Till I (skkrrrrrrttt) out in my Subaru and in the rear view is them lights
I'm talking about red white and blue
The same color as our flag
The one's that they say salute
But the ones that's whoopin my ass
And the same days that I’m happy
Is the same days that I’m mad
Cuz I can't go 24 hours without shit happening to my ass, get high

And you are not a girl your a goddess
Us  against world, girl I got us
Benihanas for them lame shits
She in the kitchen whippin cheese eggs with the same hand that she rolled the Js with
6 inch heels
5 course meals
4 years she's been my 32, my center like Shaquille
One time for my bad bitches
Whose mouths are sacreligious, cuz magic is a sin, and my dick always vanishes
Pictures on the cam of me shakin her ass
Cuz we drunk and wanna make this moment last
And the way yo back arch, when u lay on that cushion
The way yo toe's curl blowin smoke rings on the pussy
Make that muthafucka cream, from squeezin on her cookie
She want me to make her scream, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Police wanna lock me down, haters wanna shut me up
Bitches fuckin with me now, u was with me coming up
So Ima hold u down cuz u the only one that I can trust
2 fingers represent and throw it up, Lace up bitch
[Hook]
And when it all falls down, and there is nothin left
I'll still be around, Kells tatted on her breast
I look up to the stars, made a wish to have everything in a girl
Look down and there she is the baddest bitch in the world
Baddest bitch in the world
You the baddest bitch in the world
Baddest bitch in the world
She crazy but I love my babygirl, baddest bitch in the world

[Verse 2]
Popped her cherry at 14 muthafucka,
Dropped out and now she pop it-pop it-pop it like the twerk team muthafucka
Embarrassed of the fact that she a stripper
But maybe that's the reason that I'm with her
Gave me excuses to fuck with these other hoes, while she dancin on a dick
Knowin that she can't say shit
Fighting every single night, but we fuckin every day,
But She know how to hold her own, and she do everything I say
Bad bitch, 
(what she do?)
 Left class just to pick me up and smash
We ain't even go inside I just fucked her on the dash
Bad boy, so she love it when I smack her on the ass
Friends jealous cuz they wantin what she have
Scars underneath my tatts, she be worried I just laugh
Sit back and roll a zig zag up with some hash and let it ash
Cuz if the world crash then at least we already fell into love
And the J already burnin so wassup, muthafucka 
It is us against the world so wassup, muthafucka 
Back against the wall so wassup 
[Hook]
And when it all falls down, and there is nothin left
I'll still be around, Kells tatted on her breast
I look up to the stars, made a wish to have everything in a girl

Baddest bitch in the world

Miss Me?,rap,machine gun kelly,2013,58556,"[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Cleveland on my back L's up when you see me
Came from the underground now they on tv swear to god haaan
Ain't shit changed 
Fool
You can miss me with that rap shit
You can miss me with that stereotypical ""he isn’t lyrical"" barbershop chat shit
Miss me with that frat shit
Only university I graduated was Hard Knocks
I’m from Cleveland where they trap shit
Five bucks for the catfish, five bucks for the bad bitch
Five bucks in a drought in this city could get you a piece of that cactus
With saran wrap for the wrapping
Whatchu mean?
Meaning we bundling all of this loud into Garcia Vegas 
I swear its contagious the way that we passed it
Patches on my denim vest about as old as my dad is
Blood stains on my chucks cus well we know what that is
Jet lag from these long flights still sitting coach like its practice
Feeling like students when the schools back I’m trying to see what first class is 
Cash is the root of all evil
But maybe that’s why I do bad shit
Fact is, I do what I need
Cuz the country we live in is fascist
And no Catholic or Baptist, warlord or pacifist, could’ve seen what I seen without IMAX's and 3D glasses 
Yall in family houses like Bob Saget 
Both parents 
I was on family couches like ""you don’t want it?"" ill wear it
Inheriting hand me downs as a grown man, embarrassed
And these dreams seem far-fetched 
When reality is you’re sharing a shirt, shower, and shitter while your newborns in the carriage
Packaging groceries in bags for an hourly seven dollar average
This ain't living this is strife, mixed with Hennessey and some sprite
But maybe one day they’ll remember me like they remember Mike 
When I’m gone 
Uh, Kells 
Maybe they’ll remember me when I’m gone
[Hook 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
When my times up on this earth
And they bury me in the dirt
Don’t say that I ain't milk this life for everything that its worth ( everything that its worth) 
And when I die remember me like Kurt, BANG!

[Verse 2: Dub-O]
And they say Dub quit with that humble shit
You can only be cool for so long 
 Don’t misjudge  I’m not the one you wanna rumble with
Write it down, take a pic
Do whatever you gotta do to remember me
I’m in your memory for infinity 
And the same goes for your bitch 
Remember me from Kennedy 
Or East High on the east side where niggas die over anything
Yeah, Dub-O, 
Oh, you ain't know?
I got go, I rock shows, I be calling plays like Flaco, 
But I’m so Cleveland its a damn shame 
And EST is my damn gang been reppin that since way back and that double X is my campaign 
Pop bottles that champagne its Cliquot for the champions now where the hell is my damn ring?
Biatch, celebration for nothing let you believe what you see 
I’m in the back but no frontin
7 days out the week I be working I’m full of hunger 
That jealousy is the smell of defeat 
Remember who told you
I’m gone 
Remember me when I’m gone 
[Hook 2: Dub-O]
When the time is up on my watch 
And they bury me in that box
Don’t say I ain't give this game everything that I got (everything that I got)
And when I die remember me like Pac, BANG! ",en,"cleveland on my back l's up when you see me came from the underground now they on tv swear to god haaan ain't shit changed fool you can miss me with that rap shit you can miss me with that stereotypical ""he isn’t lyrical"" barbershop chat shit miss me with that frat shit only university i graduated was hard knocks i’m from cleveland where they trap shit five bucks for the catfish , five bucks for the bad bitch five bucks in a drought in this city could get you a piece of that cactus with saran wrap for the wrapping whatchu mean ? meaning we bundling all of this loud into garcia vegas i swear its contagious the way that we passed it patches on my denim vest about as old as my dad is blood stains on my chucks cus well we know what that is jet lag from these long flights still sitting coach like its practice feeling like students when the schools back i’m trying to see what first class is cash is the root of all evil but maybe that’s why i do bad shit fact is , i do what i need cuz the country we live in is fascist and no catholic or baptist , warlord or pacifist , could’ve seen what i seen without imax's and 3d glasses yall in family houses like bob saget both parents i was on family couches like ""you don’t want it ?

Street Dreams,rap,machine gun kelly,2013,84619,"[Intro]
On a east side night
Under that street light
On the corner of don’t think twice
I find my mind where it shouldn’t be

[Verse 1]
Crack Rock in that pad lock
With a stash spot in my ragtop
Street dreams down the block from my dads spot
Bad cops on my payroll
At a buck a pop like Faygo
Add 50 Cent for like 3 keys
Open up the doors for that Yayo
White nights cuz I make snow
Bright lights then I lay low
Fight nights I'm like Mike Tyson
K/o for that peso
That's the life that we chose
Talking bout
Money cars and these clothes
Fuckin with
Twenty broads that's exposed
And we in the
Strip clubs till they close
These are the chronicles of a hood muthafucka doin what he gotta do to get paid
Chronic smoke In every follicle of my shades
Writing  my obituary diggin my grave
Cuz all they say is jail or death,
And I figure there ain't nothin left
That I ain't did and since I’m knee deep in my shit, don’t hold my breath
*Snap* Oh shit
Guess its back to that broke shit
Roach clip in my ashtray
2Pac on my posters
Dreams of living like Sosa,
But I'm wakin up on this sofa,
Said I'm wakin up on this sofa
I ain't waiting round here no longer
Get it how you live it bitch we livin dirty
Most of us that's livin now ain't livin thirty
Get it how you live it bitch we livin dirty
Cock that .38 put on my mask and it gets blurry
I don't think you heard me
[Hook]
What I need a shirt for?
When you beast shit and you go hard till that tours gone and you back onto that street shit
What I need this shirt for?
When these tattoos that I bleed with say everything about my story come read this
What I need a shirt for? Huh? X3
When I go hard
So hard, to get everything that I worked for

[Verse 2]
At the top is no friends dawg
At the bottom ain't shit dawg
Middle man'n ain't it dawg
Plotting drinkin this Hen dog
And I said lord my savior
Have I not protected my neighbor
Have I not neglected these haters
Have I not kept you in my prayers
So when my life keeps going downhill am I wrong for looking upstairs?
Am I wrong for feeling you hate me, am I wrong for thinking you'd care?
Am I wrong for keepin this weed lit and these smoke clouds In this air?
But I can't sleep without my mind gone cuz of shit I witnessed last year
That boy that left out was just family
I ain't see the shit comin
We was supposed to be at these Grammy’s
We was supposed to be stuntin
Shit,  we was supposed to somethin
Fuck that we was supposed to be brothers
Helped you out when you were struggling, I don’t owe you nothing muthafucka

They told me to write a soundtrack 
For the kids who ain't have shit 
No problem, flashback me 2006 
Broke as piss, scraping bus fare up
Dolla fifty cents, get out of school and go to work
Matter fact fuck all this I quit
I got a dream that we gon change the world soon 
And one day get the fuck outta this bedroom
Maybe write a song for the girl who cries when she thinks of her past
But just press play, I tell her smile and then she laughs, look at that, yeah
Music makes the world go round 
And the ones in search of freedom generates into a crowd 
All it takes is one believer with a voice to introduce us to what’s real
And since my throat is clear I guess that’s why I’m here
Chyeah 
See my teachers told me go away to college
But what they don’t tell you is ain't no guarantees if you’re a scholar 
Even with 18 degrees, you could be jobless with Uncle Sam in your pockets
So I said fuck my doctrines
Rapped and made more money than these doctors
Now one day ill be too fly driving three girls in my four door while these five J's make a fellowship of smoke rings bitch I’m Frodo lost it all this year but bounced back like a pogo, Kells, 
[Hook]
And we just watch the sun turn into the moon 
Sit back and hope that these December nights turn into June
See it started as a dream, that dream came true
Send a message to my city tell them we'll be home soon, home soon
And we just watch the sun turn into the moon 
Sit back and hope that these December nights turn into June
See it started as a dream, that dream came true
Send a message to my city tell them we'll be home soon, home soon

[Verse 2]
And I’m like what we waiting round for
Found something to celebrate now we on round four 
Ground floor was the past now the sky is the limit penthouse edition 
Exhibit a: a bunch of young muhfuckas livin 
I used to hustle to get it
Used up all of my minutes 
In hopes of one of my ex's telling me she owned a business and heard bout my situation here’s a check for a million 
But this is reality and charity don’t go to sinners 
But clarity comes in pinners of marijuana and splinters 
An absentee in attendance at all my high school events 
I just wasn’t fond of attention when all I had was resentment 
I started out as a freshman and graduated a henchman 
I worked my way up to Jimmy 
Worked my way up the totem 
And those who hated on me was just adding weight to my scrotum
See life is a poker game I got the hand now I ain't folding
I’m King Midas touch my future with this hand now that shits golden, whoo
One day ill be too fly whippin three girls in my four door while these five J's make a fellowship of smoke rings bitch I’m Frodo lost it all this year but bounced back like a pogo, man I swear to God

Darkside of the Moon,rap,machine gun kelly,2013,60996,"[Chorus]
The dark side of the moon looks like an only child who can't fit into place
The dark side of the moon looks like a single mother bruises on her face
The dark side of the moon looks like somebody’s sister yelling out ""rape""
The dark side of the moon is eminent because you can’t escape fate
Yeah, the dark side of the moon

[Verse 1]
Tommy was young 
Tommy had everything you could want as an adolescent except for having fun
Tommy was young
Susceptible to all the repercussions of being a drunk fathers only son
Tommy was dumb
Get your ass in that room till I come back you piece of shit
But dad would never come..
Tommy was dumb
Students would laugh at him and attack him after their classes until Tommy would run
Tommy was numb
Too many years of feeling degraded now hatred is the only feeling that comes
Tommy was numb
Fuck this
Ran into his high school 
Tommy's got a gun
[Chorus]
The dark side of the moon looks like an only child who can't fit into place
The dark side of the moon looks like a single mother bruises on her face

Yeah, the dark side of the moon

Hailey's in love
But Hailey's in 7th grade entertaining and dating a 21 year old scrub
Hailey's in love
Bailing on class to give him some action in the back of his daddy’s old truck
Now Hailey threw up
A couple weeks after their interaction, guess her man didn’t use no glove
Hailey knew but
Couldn’t bear it to watch the parents she loved and cherished see their little girl knocked up
Hailey's school bus 
Got the word about what happened now even the faculty is whispering that she’s a slut
Hailey's in love
But Hailey's more afraid of being hated now her and her baby brainless in the tub, damn ",en,"the dark side of the moon looks like an only child who can't fit into place the dark side of the moon looks like a single mother bruises on her face the dark side of the moon looks like somebody’s sister yelling out ""rape"" the dark side of the moon is eminent because you can’t escape fate yeah , the dark side of the moon  tommy was young tommy had everything you could want as an adolescent except for having fun tommy was young susceptible to all the repercussions of being a drunk fathers only son tommy was dumb get your ass in that room till i come back you piece of shit but dad would never come . . tommy was dumb students would laugh at him and attack him after their classes until tommy would run tommy was numb too many years of feeling degraded now hatred is the only feeling that comes tommy was numb fuck this ran into his high school tommy's got a gun  the dark side of the moon looks like an only child who can't fit into place the dark side of the moon looks like a single mother bruises on her face the dark side of the moon looks like somebody’s sister yelling out ""rape"" the dark side of the moon is eminent because you can’t escape fate yeah , the dark side of the moon   hailey's in love but hailey's in 7th grade entertaining and dating a 21 year old scrub hailey's in love bailing on class to give him some action in the back of his daddy’s old truck now hailey threw up a couple weeks after their interaction , guess her man didn’t use no glove hailey knew but couldn’t bear it to watch the parents she loved and cherished see their little girl knocked up hailey's school bus got the word about what happened now even the faculty is whispering that she’s a slut hailey's in love but hailey's more afraid of being hated now her and her baby brainless in the tub , damn","['dark', 'moon', 'looks', 'like', 'child', 'fit', 'place', 'dark', 'moon', 'looks', 'like', 'single', 'mother', 'bruises', 'face', 'dark', 'moon', 'looks', 'like', 'somebody', 'sister', 'yelling', 'rape', 'dark', 'moon', 'eminent', 'escape', 'fate', 'yeah', 'dark', 'moon', 'tommy', 'young', 'tommy', 'want', 'adolescent', 'having', 'fun', 'tommy', 'young', 'susceptible', 'repercussions', 'drunk', 'fathers', 'son', 'tommy', 'dumb', 'ass', 'room', 'till', 'come', 'piece', 'shit', 'dad', 'come', 'tommy', 'dumb', 'students', 'laugh', 'attack', 'classes', 'tommy', 'run', 'tommy', 'numb', 'years', 'feeling', 'degraded', 'hatred', 'feeling', 'comes', 'tommy', 'numb', 'fuck', 'ran', 'high', 'school', 'tommy', 'got', 'gun', 'dark', 'moon', 'looks', 'like', 'child', 'fit', 'place', 'dark', 'moon', 'looks', 'like', 'single', 'mother', 'bruises', 'face', 'dark', 'moon', 'looks', 'like', 'somebody', 'sister', 'yelling', 'rape', 'dark', 'moon', 'eminent', 'escape', 'fate', 'yeah', 'dark', 'moon', 'hailey', 'love', 'hailey', 'grade', 'entertaining', 'dating', 'year', 'old', 'scrub', 'hailey', 'love', 'bailing', 'class', 'action', 'daddy', 'old', 'truck', 'hailey', 'threw', 'couple', 'weeks', 'interaction', 'guess', 'man', 'use', 'glove', 'hailey', 'knew', 'bear', 'watch', 'parents', 'loved', 'cherished', 'little', 'girl', 'knocked', 'hailey', 'school', 'bus', 'got', 'word', 'happened', 'faculty', 'whispering', 'slut', 'hailey', 'love', 'hailey', 'afraid', 'hated', 'baby', 'brainless', 'tub', 'damn']",4,Nightlife & Rebellion

Kells, who you wanna know?
I chop them motherfuckers down, they fallin' like Geronimo
Haters wanna holler though, hoes need to stop it
I will hit a bitch and pass her 'round the room like a Bop It
Back to the topic, uhh I think forgot it
Fuck it, I love talking 'bout my dick and how these riders jock it
Fuck him, fuck him, she's cool, fuck you

Make sure you puttin four fingers down, keep one up
Say if you ain't talkin bout no money please shut up
Me, I'm on the come up, I don't know what you bout
One million, two million, let me know how you count
Yeah, nominated youngin' of the year
I ""red rover, red rover bring the money over here""
Steer, make sure I remain in my lane
But that's symbolic cause I'm really on a plane
And I red rover, that's ironic because I don't play no games
I don't pass the rock like Jay, I ain't fuckin' with you dames
Only like what gets me paid, I ain't fuckin with you lames
Already pale, where's the raise? I ain't fuckin with the shame
I want the limelight, and the lime slice in my drink
Chain and whip without the slave, and the bitch that stays paid
At the bar buying shots, cherry bombs and grenades
Cause I go hard, you can carve it on my grave
Now wassup man I crave, travel side, first block, where you stay?
All my people back at Shaker and my partners down the way
Uptown to the Heights, St Clair to E.C
An anywhere on the eastside you're liable to see me
Boy I'm about to make a milli, but this not the C3

I am daddy to these hoes, fuck a lil pee pee
So if it's you, or me, your girl make a choice, easy
Uh, I'm spittin like I got my braces in, so much saliva my lower lip that I can't take it in
So I gotta hawk it up, spit it on the microphone
Family say I need rehab cause I can't leave the mic alone
And for that I'm guilty, but until they kill me
I'll be nasty in the sense that on this record I'll be filthy
Not literally, I'm bacteria free, the flow is ill so
Vaccinations given couldn't kill my skill
""Chill, chill"" how you gon tell me to chill doe?
When I'm hot and being slept on like a pillow
Better wake yo ass up when I'm on these instrumentals
I'm the reason half of these rappers wives turn into widows
The type of shit I been on, no toilet to sit on
Need my quarterback even though I'm sittin in the endzone

Leave Me Alone,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,7018,"*Instrumental*

(Intro)
This is just a real song, you know
MGK, Rock City Let's Go!

[Hook: Rock City]
They said I been wrong for way too long, I wish they would leave me alone
They said I ain't strong and I can't hold on, I wish they would leave me alone
He said, she said, that I'm wanted by the law, I wish they would leave me alone
And ain't no wanted man gonna get too far, I wish they would leave me alone

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I never would've thought as a kid dreaming to record
That I would've went through more ups and downs that a seesaw
But this a grown man's world so you need balls
Million and one problems, the fuck you bitching at me for?
Bruh, but what you eat doesn't make me shit
So no matter what I'mma make these hits
Cause hating on you couldn't make me rich
So I gotta, gotta go get that dollar and the fifteen cents
For the profit don't equal the rent
Shit, I'm a father, I gotta feed my kids
And I wish that I could say I had 15 friends
Who happy to see my success and don't want a piece of my ends
Cause what they don't understand is I'm struggling just like them
I just pray that my story is gon' be happy in the end
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
And I pray for happiness in these sad times
Hope someday my life will bubble like it's bath time
What else? Maybe somewhere countin' numbers like it's math time
So I gotta grind, no breaks, fuck halftime
I've had a job since fourteen
Pushing carts, fast food, scrubbing floors, yeah I done the whole thing
But I was fed up, couldn't just work for anybody
And I guess it's true what they say, school's not for everybody
I'm just a dropout, nineteen with no hope
But my notebook front to back is full of big dreams of SoHo
And I don't know, how to answer my girl when she ask
When you gonna work and leave this music in the past?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
If it is what I ask for, a little money in my pocket and a passport
But I never knew that it would come at the price
Of a hundred people hatin on me, now I gotta wear a mask or
Just fast forward, cause the internet thug in this city wanna see you fail
But if you rewind, know I've been through hell
So no matter what I will prevail
So my father or my daughter or myself and all my team
And these labels couldn't change me either, not one thing
See the streets want me to thug, and corporate America thinks I'm priceless
If I remove the curse and live my life like Miley Cyrus
But I'm none of that, fuck that, the money couldn't change me
Still the underdog, still the kid, it's the same me
Came from the bottom on my own

[Intro]
Look, when you mentioning Cole
Why ain't you mentioning Kells?
And when you talking 'bout greats, better put me up there with Drake
And when they mentioning lyrics I hear 'em talking 'bout Kendrick
But next time put my name it it before you finish that sentence, Fool

[Verse 1: MGK]
Kid Kells Boy lemme get my 2's in
The game open they doors for me
Boy tell me who let you  in
And a crack between the walls so small you couldn't even fit your boots in
Dump heat whenever I speak
MC's 6 feet deep underneath all them tulips
Now he shootin', shootin'

[Cough, Cough]
MGK Man he...
[Cough, Cough]
Flow sick and I just...
[Cough, Cough]
Epidemic in the street..
[Cough, Cough]
Suck on my dick n' you will...

Smoke a little weed and get

Higher than a motherfucker
'til somebody holler my name out in the street like...
[Machine Gun Sound]
Okay, I meet him, greet him
Get his girl, leave him
Guts, I beat them
Booties, I keep them
Another set of PO, cups to pee in
I'm in England spending Euros treatin'
So instead of white, im European
Rap like crack now, you're ODin'
Come at me with any drama, my family ties
Will fold you up like an accordion
And according to the crack in the sidewalk
Most these rappers bitches
Breaking down my doors with beef
I will rip you, rip you off your hinges
Quit pretending you pretentious
Or vicious, then come get at me
Red dots all over your face like acne
CLICK CLACK
[Machine Gun Noise]

[Verse 2: MGK]
Look, they be sayin' best rapper alive, Who?
Kells who you oughta know
I chop these other rappers down they fallin' like Geronimo
Holla though, Haters n' the foes need to stop it
I will hit that bitch, pass her 'round the room like a bop-it
Back to the topic, and in case you forgot it
I was all about my dick, and how you haters jock it
F him, F him, She's ight, F You
And if you forgot procedure lemme show you what to do:
Make sure you keep four fingers down, keep one up
Say if you ain't talking about more money please shut up
Me, I'm on the come up, I don't know what you 'bout
One million, two million, let me know how you count
And I'm nominated as youngin' of the year
Red Rover, Red Rover, bring that money over here
And steer, and make sure I remain in my lane
But that's symbolic cause I'm really on a plane
Look, and I Red Rover, that's ironic, because I don't play no games
I don't pass or rock like J
I ain't messing with you lames
Hold on, uh
Said I don't pass or rock like J
Cause I ain't with you dames
Excuse my back trick, need no practice
Cause I spit crack like Nino rapped this
And I'm a star in the galactic
Being forward with the kid the wrong way
Or get your head spun backwards
Open cans of whoop-ass like I unpacked it
I've been patient all week and now I feast on savage
And eat each haters heads up like cabbage
To eternally bind them in my stomach like marriage
This fairy needs medical, call up the horse and carriage
We don't, dig this, grab a shovel get buried
If I don't get my respect i will, cut your family
Cut you mother, Cut your sister, more importantly your daddy
Should run up but he ain't half the man

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here, and it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase

[Chorus]
When you'd cry, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still...

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Workin', sweatin' from the stress of being caged down
Everything I write is being played out, like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes in the wall
But they don't know the past
Even if I told 'em it all
They wouldn't know the half
So maybe I'll fill up my luggage with all of these dreams
And put on my black coat and my black chucks
And nothing in my jeans
And just run, til the day comes like Rocky's movie scene
And lay up on the top of the world, look up and scream
Like this is me, this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city, but clearly I never failed
Lost myself in the game, but I found myself in the cell
Then I found myself in the fame, and lost myself in the pills
And they can not mess with me still
See the boys, and they winning, underdogs of the year
Cleveland boys in the building, what the fuck is a ceiling?
I'm taking this to the top
And when I leave the whole world drops
Lace up, Kells

Why? She ain't never to blame
When she swallow, had me thinking that I never came with me at the funeral
With me at the wake, black dress, black shades

I can't explain death, well you don't understand life
Grandma passed about a week before mother's day
Forgive me, I was worried about [?]
Bad as it sounds, I wouldn't have it any other way
Why?
She was so ill, death would have been her only escape
Got a mask, had to make me feel
Why?
Since the streets is only askin' bout a shady dealer
If I knew now what tomorrow was gonna teach me
And I told you in advance
You probably wouldn't believe me..

I never knew a love
A love that could be sweeter
No matter what my mind says
Your music gives me feelin

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Damn) can anybody give me a sound
The sky’s too quiet, somebody show me the ground
Coz I’m blinded by the clouds
Precipitations too heavy I won’t bow (down)
Back to the lab, crowds remove my crown, flood my town
Seas of free people drowning
If I see black cats then I take grey hounds
(Damn) where ever my eye brows frown
I never knew that love until I started to count
Shining with the stars in the spacious lounge
But I Divorce the ball so I'm on the rebound
Shame a woman’s best friend is a man's first child
Coz my weakness for a smile, just reinstated my vows
Matrimony got us walking up the aisle
Me and my guidance agree
In love with the lifestyles
[Chorus: iiO & Machine Gun Kelly ]
(I never knew a love)
I never knew a love like this
Power enamblin me, to flourish in my sins

Sweeter then a females lips
Kiss like the diamonds that smile on my wrist

Even when though mind says this
My heart keeps pumpin, oh they the hot shit
(Your music gives me feelin')
Pain is for the masses captured
People bring me down, materials uplift

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Life, what a vacation
Even on my ego trips, no rooms vacant
And tenants giving 10 inches of the hatred
Still not want One foot in my greatness
My statement, I am prodigy, prophecy
Neo to the matrix, hip hop's savior
Outer space patron, married to the game, only stars I’m datin
My love is unconditional but only to the Franklins
Councilin don’t ever prevent separation
You complete my life’s equation
My love couldn’t amount to the songs you gave me
When I wanted out it was you that saved me
Flaunted you for clout now I’m Patrick Swayze
Was a street rat, now an apes and baby
Seen a couple places now for you I’m crazy
[Chorus: IIO & Machine Gun Kelly]
(I never knew a love)
I never knew a love like this
Power enamblin me, to flourish in my sins
(A love that could be sweeter)
Sweeter then a females lips
Kiss like the diamonds that smile on my wrist
(No matter what my mind says)
Even when though mind says this
My heart keeps pumpin, oh they the hot shit

Never hustled, never will blow? (You!)
Who's the latest underrated in the game?
And who's the greatest? The answer is...y'all know (Kells)
Who the muthafucka still broke? (You!)

[Verse 1]
Cleveland got my back I put the weight of that on my shoulder
I'm an insomniac so I can't take a nap when I'm sober
They say sleep is the devil, I just made friends with Jehovah
Stop sleeping on me, I just broke bread with Hova
I'm talking Jigga man, hundred fucking million man
Hundred hustlers at Puff's crib, no civilians there
Do not get it twisted 'cause I never pose for pictures, man
I'm living the life you haters picture on the Instagram
Now these rappers tryna floss I see
Flirting with temptation, they Diana Ross I see
And I heard them names was fake and must've lost ID
And they must be employees 'cause they ain't boss like me (Kells!)
I call up Flex, he drop a bomb on it
Pick the song, bet I get everyone and they mom on it
Pick a city, I bet I show up and there's people screaming
And that's any given Sunday, I call that Willy Beaman
And I'm really speeding, lot of warning signs I ain't really reading
People wanna sign like I'm L.A. Reid
And I'm smoking this L.A. weed while I'm ducking LAPD
Fucking hoes, UCLA foreign exchange students European
Champagne is European, all of my bitches peeing
Eleven hundred dollars now my toilet is Veuve Clicquot
I just called up The Weeknd and told him call off the weekend
I'll call a hundred bitches, and all of them Puerto Rican
I am the Wolf on Wall Street, penny stock flipper
One that ran up in Interscope and left with seven figures
Managed to keep it real in every one of his lyrics
Now I can't say it but you know I'm that muhfuckin...(yeah, yeah)
Fuck a magazine we load a magazine in the clip
I ain't average man, I produce gasoline when I spit
Put fire verses on trampolines and I make a flip
Life on the edge like I build a mezzanine on a cliff
I'm just talkin' now 'cause it ain't even ten in the morning
That means I wrote this shit the same time e'rybody yawning
That means while you was eating cereal I was recording
I'm 23 and in my prime, that means I'm Michael Jordan

Let me get my theme music, Kells
Some say, you can only judge a man by what he has
And I got a whole city behind me..

(Whatup, yeah)
Let it run

I like this
(Whatup, yeah, whatup)
And you know what they say
With great power comes great responsibility (yeah)
And let it be known
I got this

[Verse 1: MGK]
We are, the best motherfuckers in this spot
They can't see who's in it cause the windows all tinted
This is, more than the business, the fame and the image
This is natural, no gimmicks, rappers actin' like Gwyneth
Lumps in my denim they swear I done shitted'
I don't give a flyin' fuck that's why they call me ""lieutenant""
Try to play me like a kitten, homie you kiddin?
You rappers are nothing serious, I call you a scrimmage
Breathe, bring it back to the map
We just grinding here first, we just happened to rap
Lost a friend to the night, still battlin' that
There wasn't any type of show, they just happened to clap
Promised him, if you music's a race, I'd be running the track
And if I come out the winner, I ain't runnin' it back
Wasted my whole entire life runnin' from Jack
Once in a lifetime's now and I ain't runnin' from that, yeah
We own the night, all black Chucks on
The new generation, no black tux on
Rather fitted jeans, no inches to cut on
And the talent that you willin' to bet a million bucks on
This is my story, so this is real shit
Everything I want, this is what the real get
Dream big, the Empire State feelin'
Money taller than the Empire State building
Don't get it twisted, I ain't rich yet, but I'm straight
Whoever thought I'd make that killin' of my wordplay
I did, I've been knowing since the first day
Revenge can be many things, success is the worst way
I see they faces now, but I'm way too real to care
My night is coming soon, I feel it in the air
Somebody's gotta run the town before the smoke clears
This kingdom is now without a king, look people I'm here
[Hook: Rihanna]
Life’s a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don’t care
So I keep doing my own thing
Walking tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind is who’s gonna run this town tonight
Hey (etc.)
Who’s gonna run this town tonight

'Cause you ain't got swag like this
Nah, you ain't got swag like this
Call me Tazer Tezo, a.k.a. Young Mercy Marty
Look at me I'm gorgeous, everything is flawless
[Verse 2- MGK]
Young Kells spit that dope
Y'all rappers spit that soap
That's that fake, y'all can't hang
Matter fact, take it back, grab that rope
Die Slow. I'm a bipolar, my bitch bisexual
She eat that pussy like vegetable
She just want green, cooking up edibles
Everyday I put 'get high' on my schedule
Smoke until I cough, I love to break the law
I'ma stay in the streets
Ya'll pigs can find a Trough
All I did was rap
Put it on the wall
Look at all the plaques
Still the underdog (mufucka!)

[Verse 3- Tezo]
Hop out the Porsche like fuck it, nigga
Ride the bench or score some buckets, nigga
Yo bitch my bitch, oh yeah, we fuckin', nigga
Had her at the crib, you know she runnin', nigga

[Verse 4 - MGK]
Yeah, so I hopped off that Porsche like fuck it, bitch

And if you never had a penny, don't you wanna ball?
Used to fall asleep with the stomach empty, now don't you wanna ball?
Tattoos like Makaveli, the shit that make you wanna ball
And I'm a die when I'm ready, but I'm living so I want it all

[Verse 1]
Me and my dogs getting blow biatch
My little brother just got out of parole biatch
My daughter just turned five-years old biatch
And we ain't mopping no mo' floors biatch
None of my brothers work 9-5
Never scared living life, we got nine lives
Keep it hood with the Hen, no Mai Tai
Smoking on la-la, bumping Big Poppa
I mean look at all the shit we been through
Seven people in a four door rental
I mean look at what we did with a pencil
Beat a statistic  of becoming another stencil
I mean an outline on that sidewalk
Man I'm supposed to be dead and that's real talk

[Verse 2]
I wonder what you got for a little muhafucka
A real muhfucka, chill muhfucka
I guess it's God's will
Yet and still, I'm in the field with dollar bills
To track sharks with no gills, ready to kill muhfuckas
And I don't want no part of that
The first time I heard kat-kat-kat
I almost had a fucking heart attack
Stuttering like that-that-that shit was crazy
Maybe it's time I used the talent that God gave me
But I was just local
Didn't have a rap name, I was just hopeful
Paid for my first studio session with quarters
We didn't even have enough money to cut vocals, damn
Traded pop cans for dimes
Some wanna be doctors, I wanted to rhyme
And if following your dreams is a crime, then I'm a crook
Guess I'll be in the book, when they get me, in due time

On first block with the blunt rolled, me and Dub-O

Throwing hands in the hall on the first day
Scared of one of my hoes gettin' knocked up

Against the world,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,42882,"[Intro]
Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there’s no one else to blame

Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small, and needy
Warm me up and breathe me

[Verse 1]
Uh, it's just me against the world
Lost my mistress and my girl
All they wanted was what's in my safe
And all I wanted was  just to be great
Contemplate, real or fake, all these people in my face
Wasn't ready for the fame, I flipped my shit and caught a case, Looking at my fans like I can't ball without a base
They understand, ride till the end
Now bow our heads and let us pray, Amen
[Interlude]
And after all these years of crime and malice
I look down and see I'm cold and calloused
And while our sins are to fifthly to bear
We have to wash them down, now grab your chalice

[Refrain]
And toast to those who always raised their glasses
When most never chose to go against the masses
So if you ride or die let me see them Ls
And I'll take you to a place where we can be ourselves

[Verse 2]
Look, Hollywood is not my type of party
Nah, look what happened to Chris Farley
Rest in peace him and Christopher Wallace, mo' money, mo' problems
And less people then when you started, shit
And you wonder why I don't drink coffee
I don't wanna wake up to these problems of a boss like John Gotti
I'd rather be Che Guevara mixed with a little bit of Marcus Garvey In hopes of a revolution as results of my anarchy
But I’m hardly ever home so I guess I'll be quick
Everybody wanna have their two cents: take it, here, I don't owe y'all shit
Smoke a zip, change my clothes and give my five-year-old a kiss
Family mad at my success, don't they say hate is where home is?
Damn
So it's just me against the world
Lost my mistress and my girl
All they wanted was what's in my safe
When all I wanted was  just to be great, Kells
[Interlude 2]
But greatness is in the eye of the beholder, so it starts with you. Believe in your own abilities the way you have believed in mine
It's time, put 'em up

[Refrain]
Let's toast to those who always raised their glasses
When most never chose to go against the masses
Now I know you ride or die, so let me see them Ls
And be proud you are not afraid to be yourself

[Verse 3]
If they want me come and get me, unload this clip till it's empty
And I ain't startled motherfucker
Do what ever I must to protect my brother
Respect no other, put no man above each other
This is what you live out when you trying to make it out the gutter
This is how you show that precious little baby girl you love her
This is how you step up as a man and get that bread and butter
But get by, all we do is get by
Ironic how we're lower class but always seem to get high
And the chronic seller is the man 'cause he got the supply
Get it? Demand and supply, make that spinach, get that Popeye

I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then i wake up to see the world's ill
Oceans tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish that i could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow.​

But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?
[Hook: Victoria Monet + Machine Gun Kelly]
I think we all need a little more love
I think we all need a little more love
We just need a little more love
The world needs a little more love

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells, In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
Cause it feels like the government just as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catching up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night i'm supposed to lose
Just ​'​cause in hindsight, they don't like my type:
White boy with some rhythm and blues
Kells

I think we all need a little more love

[Outro-Verse: Machine Gun Kelly + Victoria Monet]
You can give up like they tell you, stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
​but I'm tryIng to tell you
Fuck what they tell you

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly & Victoria Monet]
​And in these dark times
​As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved it’s important to know we’re not blind
​We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
​And I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees if I can't live free
Right now in the world we just need
A little more love
A little more love

Rapping On The Couch Freestyle,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,19717,"Yo, I haven't wrote a song in a while
I guess I've been down
Guess I didn't the have energy to pick a pen up
Shit, I barely have the energy to crack smiles
Similar to back in the class, I was barely gonna pass
With a flask full of Jack and a book full of raps and an ear full of laughs
Similar to back when I barely had some money for the gas, ask
Pops if I can borrow the car today
Someone asked me to be on a song today
And they said I can do a couple shows wit' em
If I help them sell a couple of tickets at the mall today
But hey
I know you wanna see me keep a job
Keep school first, blah blah blah
But all I got, is this one shot
And I'm taking it to the top
If I don't gotta load up another box
In this Penske truck, fuck that
'Cause next year the rent be up, fuck that
And my bank is empty bruh, fuck that
The world tryin' to set me up, fuck that
So I bounce back like jumping jacks
Take a pull, and see how my lungs react
And I don't give a fuck if it kills the brain
'Cuz reality itself is killing me mane
So I need an ounce of weed, and house for me
Everyday when I wake up
A hippie bitch with no make up
Who loves to fuck and roll J's up
Fat ass with little A cups
You know just what I'm sayin', 'cuz
And I'm like fuck 15 minutes
I'm trying to live infinite
I don't got a big yacht
My legacy is all I got
So I call three bitches and my dealer on the same cell
Told them to pull up to the something place hotel
Felt like I had maids in the room
Girl cleanin' dust off the surface like brooms
Shit, you know I gotta start my day off with a shot
Cheese eggs in the middle of the pot
Throw a little leather on the wrist
'Bout four rings on the fists, bitch
Why I need a watch?
And it's always my time
Even back before the young man got signed
Even back before the mixtapes got heard
I was in the streets, fuck being online
And if you wanna turn up, we can turn up like a motha fucka
I pay fifty for a shot like fuck it
Small price when you keep one hunnit
True thanks on the red carpet get blunted
Never changed for the public
Y'all look disgustin'
Look at me court side next to Kate Upton
Look at me pouring 5 cups of White Russian
Speaking of which, bitch, I just came through customs
Speaking of which I been dreaming of this to redeem
All those years I was treated like shit to receive
The awards that my peers seems to get
Received a convertible top on this whip
Bitch I feel like Fif'
Time to get rich or die tryin'
Tired of heating grilled cheese up on my iron
Its time to get three hoes or more, Frankie Lymon
The weed man can call it good timin'
'Cuz I need an ounce of weed, and a house for me
Everyday when I wake up, Bitch
I need some Hennessy and a house for me
Everyday when I wake up

Now tell me, now tell me, do that sound familiar?
If you from Cleveland, you are la familia
If you get money one hundred, you know that we feelin' ya
[Verse 5: Machine Gun Kelly]
Hold up, bitch, I'm from the land and y'all know that
Y'all never should have let me go back
Even when I didn't have no plaque
I was courtside in the Cavaliers throwback (Ey!)
I was on the 19 ridin' up Miles
Back when I was nineteen turnin' up wild
I was in the flats when the land slanged goals
Ridin' up Satchel when them boys slanged hoes
I was on the Clair when Al came down
Leavin' out of work, went to rap it downtown (Right?)
I was in the club when they played ""We Ball""
And I repped my hood and everybody started brawlin'
Back when I was sixteen, I was spittin' sixteen
Hoppin' up the Blue Line on 116 (Yeah)
Tryna get my fifteen minutes of fame, shit changed
Now I'm on the big screen like-

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]
Bitch, I'm from East, East 1999, the 9999
Bitch, I'm from East, East 1999, the 9999
Bitch, I'm from East, East 1999, the 9999
Bitch, I'm from East, East 1999, the 9999
Bitch, I'm from the land

Warning Shot Original Version,pop,machine gun kelly,2011,489,"[Hook:]
This is our warning shot ah ah
The final call
This is our warning shot ah ah
The final call
This is our warning shot ah ah
The final call, the final call
This is our warning shot ah ah
The final call

Came in no clout small bank and my big mouth
Small name but these big shots know just' what this kids bout
I said shit then I ment shit, corenor I dead shit
I treat hoes just like hoes that through bones go fetch shit
I'm pitbull, that x shit, that goin in at they neck shit
That we gon have a problem if I am not on the next shit
Cause I wreck shit can't tame me I'm eminem and I'm jay z
I'm a renegade this rap shit me and all my boy like a-team
Fuck wrong with y'all this is my warning shot so I better see you ghost

Boy I'm from the c-l-e-v-e-l-a-n-d and I will be reppin that until I die
And you either with me or riding against me so lemme know put them l's up in the sky lace up
[Hook x2]
Call me the man, no better yet call me the kid
Cause ain't nobody this young done what I did
Cause ain't nobody this young go through the shit I went through these past couple years and lived
Y'all suckers, hickey shit
I'm a real rockstar nikki sixx
I'm minajin y'all jus watching got damn y'all nikki's bitch
Can the game get anymore corny?
Can the fame get anymore boring?
Can any lame y'all think is dope put out garbage and make it easy for me?
Is it possible for anyone to adore me
Is it possible for anyone to record me
So I can address all the people that took my clothes, videos, songs and put em out before me
And it's impossible to die
Possibly to live with the endless lyrics? somebody call the paramedics
Somebody call the fucking paramedics
Is it even possible to lack the academics to get the credit in the city and never spend a minute in a class
Fuck that kiss my ass, drink til it's pitch black roll it up let me hit it

Almost,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,39836,"[Verse 1]
Almost, to the top
Almost famous, shit y'all know
Hesitation, don’t get none
Still I’ll go to the basement, put Vice City in the PlayStation
Get away from stress, keep Js rotatin'
Dab rings and a bad bitch naked, I just wanna live

[Interlude]
See that’s what the fuck I’m talkin' about right there
Yeah yeah, I just wanna live
Let me smoke my weed in public, eat this In-N-Out burger
Can I, live? Sleep in 'til mothafuckin' noon and fuck my bitch
You know what I’m saying?
That’s my perfect world right there

[Verse 2]
Back to it
What if I don’t wanna work?
For a boss I don’t get along with
Name tag on a shirt
I’d rather be at home doing bong rips
But I’m just being real
A lil' irresponsible but I don’t really give a fuck how you feel
'Cause this ain’t your life
This is all my shit, my shit
Don’t worry about where I’m at, who I’m wit'
Commenting on the words that come from my lips
Bitch, please excuse my wrist
While I whip, whip, whip, whip
The car they said I couldn’t get
With the all black leather on, looking like the Matrix
I am the one light 2 joints, 35 millimeter life viewpoint
Everything is like a movie nowadays
Speaking of I did a movie the other day, ay!
I just, I just, I just wanna know am I being modest?
Asking 50k a show, or do I need mo’?
For all of the years it was slow
For every show where no one would’ve showed
For driving 12 hours to perform in the cold
Getting to the do’ and being told no
Bitch I want all that back times ten
Say it again, bitch I want all that back times ten
Bitch, I want all that back times ten
One more ‘gain, bitch I want all that back times ten

Blue Skies,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,91982,"[Intro]
Blue skies
There's nothing but blue skies
Blue skies (see me)
There's nothing but blue skies
(Throw it up when you see me)

[Verse 1]
Look, never had a cent now I got a bent
I ain’t talkin Bentley’s, I’m talkin' a bitch
I got her bent over she bustin' them splits
Lookin' up at the star, I’m tellin' her make a wish
Hoes come around me tryna leave rich
But I give ‘em no shit so they leave pissed
Fuck ‘em, here's to the night, like Eve 6
My partner ain’t gotta put the dough in the deep dish
Mic check, can you hear me?
I’m loud as a symphony
Smoke in my lungs, I’m a chimney
Get it in your head like epiphanies
Realize I am Prince Akeem, I roll with the semi
So many repent me, part of ‘em resent me
They think I’m Lucifer, I think God blessed me
I was in hell while you rappers on Jet ski’s
How in the fuck can yo raps represent me?
I was on ten, now I’m on fifty
I just spent a hundred, tell ‘em roll it up quickly
I just got a hundred missed calls from the city
Keep it 100, everybody fuck wit me
Keep it 100, Kells, Keep it 100
Fuck ya’ll, you don’t know nothing
I keep it 3 thou like Andre
I done been an Outkast since I came up out mom's stomach
I been smoking weed since I was a fetus
Lil bad mothafucka, needed Baby Jesus
Tryna be a millionaire, where the fuck Regis?
Leaders of the new school and we all teachers
First lesson: blue skies, blue dream, red eyes and catch red eye
Fuck the real world, Kells
[Chorus]
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, stay real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, for real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, stay real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, for real

[Bridge]
If ya’ll ride wit me, roll one up and get high wit me
Turn it up and then vibe wit me, fuck the real world
If ya’ll ride wit me, roll one up and get high wit me
Turn it up and then vibe wit me
Kells!

[Verse 2]
24/7 I’m putting in work
Came from the gutter, no stain on my shirt
You know the Land is where champions birthed
So I hold the title till I land in the dirt
Motorcycles, auto-rifles, and purp
Overnight they think I tripled my worth
Gotta stay ready, these haters will lurk
But this ain’t what you want, now I’m feelin like Durk
(This ain’t what you want)
Sing that shit to ‘em like Gerald Levert
Couldn’t sleep on me with Ambien first
Let the kid nap like an Amber alert
Wake up and you know I had to get turnt
Bottle of Jameson matching my shirt
Back on the road, gotta pack up the merch
And I smoke so much tree that I damage the earth
Yeah, EST runs shit
Don’t make me get on my young shit
Don’t get me talking that gun shit
Don’t make me turn this whole thing to a function
Don’t make assumptions
I’m from the C, I ain’t talkin bout Compton
I’m from the 6, I ain’t talkin Toronto
Bitch I’m from Cleveland, you know the motto
I’m the city’s Lucky Luciano, the gunner!
[Chorus]
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, stay real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, for real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, stay real

What's really good?
Niggas tell me that I made it when I hit the hood
Old girl gave it up like I knew she would
When you saw me, you ain't swing like I knew you would
On that fake shit, that's a Whoopie Cushion
Old from the start type and he ain't gettin whoopings
I could tell, crabs in the bucket if I fall I'll break shells
They hating on Jesus, I ain't tripping, oh well
I'm just tryna live, word to bond
Swipe it like a visa, catch me if you cheetah
Franklin's new Aretha
I am great, nice to meet ya
On my toes like a ballerina
After this shit drop, I won't be making pizzas
I ain't never lie, killin everything moving, Mr. Homicide
Mr. Dinner Date, Mr. My Guy
I been doing this but right now I'm at an all time high
I heard you talkin shit but I'ma let it slide
And maybe your chick too, I shine like a gold tooth
'Cause niggas is so poop
Fetch me a trash can, I'm suttin like Shaftman
Yeah, body body like P in 97 man
Ya'll niggas out here lookin like Terry
Ya'll niggas out here lookin like
Made peace with the past, hello future
Can't look back, no time for that
Waiting on a miracle, you can't do that
You gotta go and get it like a pick up order, ayy
I woke up out in California, my Cali chick like good morning
Food cooked, weed rolled for me
I just laugh cause I think it's funny
Everybody love you when they think that you getting money
Ayy, I can't wait to ball, like a bad ass kid, tear up the mall
And she got some on, tell her pull down them drawers
Hit it on the first night, I never call
Married to the game, rockin chains instead of wedding ring
If he in the way stretch him out like a limousine
These niggas frontin they don't want the cake like Anna Mae
I am here to stay, I put that on everything

Trill, too real, too ill
Excuse me if I do not do it for the camera

Wit' fifty pounds of the sticky icky
Straight from the [?] boys in the Windy City
Pity, pity these motherfuckas smokin' bunk
I light a J and kill a verse, put that shit in the trunk
Back in shaker used to kill 'em on the table a ton
Bet a couple dollars you could lose the shit if you want
Fuck a rest, still chase change
Always make the motherfucker money
Never let the money make me, bitch
Young gunner, salute when you see me
I live what I'm rapping for real, you just do it for TV, believe me
My hands bulimic, throwin up L's
Those fans deleted wack rappers and listen to Kells
Used to walk up to the dairy market, get me a shell
Cop a gram from the 5 for my homies in bail
Still 357 under the front of my belt
Now my album is selling off the fuckin' front of the shelves
This a evolution, a real motherfucker made it, what a revolution
Still mo'fuckers hate it, but they couldn't do it
Let me educate the students
You couldn't measure my ground with eighty-million rulers
I do this
Shhh, you could try me if you want and be foolish
But I'm the champion, that means that everyone else loses
You put that money on me, guaranteed you'll recoup it
Bitch, I am legend, name a rapper that I haven't influenced

I ain't slept in months y'all
Eyes so red I can't see what's real
R-r-roll me up a blunt dog
Sorry but this is the way that I live
And if the world so big why can't I fit in?
Feels just like folks back in the sit in
Because I ain't goin' no where unless I eat and
I won't play the game cause everybody cheat but
I will pay the toll cause life ain't cheap
Keep Pac on the beat all eyes on me
See I on the streets not I
In-the-stry eye for an eye when it comes to the beef
Got a problem with me don't come to the C
216 to the 213 that's what I call 21 jump street
Never jump ship though that shit weak same crew
Same boat muhfuka' don't sink I'm sayin'

Long nights, contemplating
Stopping Satan from taking my life

Strange faces, this is my life
This is my life, this is my life

[Interlude]
Let me tell you something you already know
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows
It's a very mean and nasty place and i don't care how
Tough you are it will beat you to your knees and will
Keep you there permanently if you let it you, me or
Nobody will hit as hard as life but it ain't about how
Hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and
Keep moving forward how much you can take and keep
Moving forward that's how winners done (how winners done)
(how winners done) (how winners done)

[Hook: Earl St. Clair]
Let me tell you how the story goes
See I was born to rock and roll
My momma kept me close to home
While my daddy was a rolling stone
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Who remembers tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents?
Who remembers sneaking into liquor stores tryna get bent?
Who remembers stealing every album out of pop's old car?
And listening to those growning up tryna be a rock star
Back in the days, back in the – back in the days, backpack full of Andres
That's three stacks and The Chronic, no wait
More like three dollars and a 2Pac tape
Principal calling my dad, ""Colson isn't showin' up to class
Colson got into a fight, your son isn't gonna pass""
Well, you're damn right, my books were in the trash
I was at Sharks, playing guitar with the band, jam
Pretend like we were playing for some fans
Go to chance, pretendin' like we was paying some bands, ran
Security caught us we, got banned, now dad's at home
Drunk, waiting with heavy hands, bam
So I ran away with whatever CD it was that I was gonna play
Music always had my back when it's just me in the dark
Fell asleep on the slide in the park, wake up!

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Today I took four shots
Leaned out my window and pissed on four cops
Noise complaints every day, knock knock
But I'm busy with four porn stars on my cock
Busy damagin' hotels and gift shops
Quick to shoplift, take a wrist watch
Put me on a stage at a show and I mosh
I done shaved so much blow that I rock
Do not try this shit at home
Seem like every morning my lawyer is on the phone
Talkin' 'bout another fight or another case from another night
With a dude backstage at a place upstate but I'm done with it
My life, have fun with it; call my little brother Rook, tell him ""get the drums hittin'""
Tell the rest of the band to plug up, and yell to the rest of these bands to shut up!
Mic check 1, 2, if you don't like me than check your IQ
'Cause I ain't dumb, my mind is just numb from all the substance inside that I've done
I had to try some, be wild while I'm young, go in the strip club with all of my ones
But you don't want to live my life, I'm just telling you about the highlights, Kells

Hold on let me catch my breath
Ok over here to the left
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I like this)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (right side what's up?)

The Register,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,21389,"Yeah, okay
Now there’s a meaning to this thing called life
But you just gotta find it in this thing called strife
I wish I could rewind and show you this is all hype
Show you just because they stars doesn’t mean they got stripes, for real though
But me, I got them verses that’ll kill though
And me, I’m EST, now that’s a family I would kill for
Shout out to the fans who held me down before the deal though
And I can’t forget my team, I pray one day we make a million, and blow it all
'Cause when we die we ain’t taking it wit' us
Materials make a king, knowledge makes an apprentice
Now ain’t that backwards, we impressed by the fame in this era
My girl a queen, she don’t need a tiara
She don’t need an umbrella either just give her the reign
We don’t need help, they built the pyramids without a crane
Insane sometimes I feel we born without a brain
We only looking at the dollars, what we really need is change
I'm sayin', if that shit doesn’t register, might as well get used to stealin' singles out the register
Baby momma calling, she need 30 for a pedicure
Student loan collector blow your phone up on the regular
How we supposed to live baby? This isn’t it baby
We supposed to have a condo and a crib baby, damn
But you forgot the first rule of the game
They don’t remember riches, they just remember the name
Kells
Uh, so go and get it homie
One thing for sure I know the block ain’t gonna get it for me
Two thing’s for certain, I ain’t tryna let 'em pigeon toe me
And if they is just know I’m walking wit' my pistol on me
This ain’t that B shit or C shit, this is that D-O-or-D shit
That means Do or Die, 'cause ain’t no you, if it’s you and I
I ain’t a gangster but I will be just to stay alive
I’m rollin’ in the cut, staying high
Roll to the cinema and stay the night
My life’s like TV with this daytime drama
All this Law and Order, a lot of comedy
And relationships like Tina and Ike, these bitches craaaaaazy
That’s why I’m tellin’ ya
Look up at the sky instead of starin' at a cellular
You could be the greatest, why would you wanna be regular?
Just know that your greatness comes from how they gon’ remember ya
Not from how you spend baby, that isn’t it baby
You ain’t gotta have a condo or a crib baby
But now you know the first rule of the game
They don’t remember riches, they just remember the name
They don’t remember
They just remember the name
Kells
Rose from the ashes like a Phoenix
Rows fillin', rows fillin' up in them arenas
Got my weight up in my hood we call that triple-beamin’
Fuck introductions, skip the name and just call me Cleveland
Homie calling for bail, tryna get out this precinct
Tell ‘em we give ‘em hell, funny I started preaching
And when I say I gotta respect the city you gon’ believe it
'Cause everybody left us and they know I’m never leavin'
So I turn it up one time for the days standing on the corner
Talkin shit and getting lifted, sippin’ brews and Arizona
And when one time came through everybody gone except for me
I couldn’t leave, I am a loner, with the mind of a stoner
And dreams of putting this game in a choker
And fuckin' her till she pay me like Oprah
I’m not a hoper, I’m a knower
Of what's in the forecast like Al Roker
So even if it pours, I am Noah, two oars
Two rowers, row us to two shores
Found promised land, now we lying on two floors
One for the fam, the other for two whores
Fuck two minutes, I did this in two chords, of course
I’m too versatile for a chorus
Done too many tours to be a tourist
Fuck the magazine, I am The Source
I am too bossed to be employed
More stories about your boy than Chuck Norris

Everybody say they loyal, tell me where the fuck is they though?
We ain’t never see you bitches, Carmen San Diego
I ain’t ever sold my soul, I ain’t ever had no halo
Smoke J’s big as egg rolls, hit that Jose Canseco
Mix that OJ and Cuervo, so high that I see angels
Came all the way from the kitchen, frying them potatoes
And y'all can talk all you want to
'Cause it will never be in my face though
And ya’ll mothafuckas keep lookin, but can’t nobody fill my space ho
I’m the realest mothafucka, I’m on some UGK
Trillest mothafucka, you feel me mane?

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Asshole, kinda moody, ho

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Original nigga I’ve never been cloned
Never been sober, I’m high like a drone
Smoking a cone, used to distribute cocaine in your zone
But shit I moved on, to bigger and better
I’m smarter and wiser, so this shouldn’t be a surprise
See me pull up in the foreigner size of shotgun shug where I used to reside bra
You gots to be in the gym, physically fit if you comin for him
You already know that I’m coming with them, trigger it in cause you sink or you swim
So don’t get down cause you might get drowned cause I don’t fuck around my brother
So don’t make a sound just shut up before I hit you with the quarter pound muh'fucker
Anybody wanna catch a square anytime, any place I'll be right there
Standing in the middle of the motherfucking street
Ready with them hands and I'm ready with the heat
Took all my feet that I been that I look
You can play if you want but you will get took
Bumping them gloves, oh look you a piece with a hook
Real quick life is bitch you shooked look
I wrote the book on this real shit
25 years and I still spit
Murder the mic and I kill shit
And that's something you folks have to deal with
Bring me your boss and I put him to work
Eat him for lunch and then that's fo' dessert
Fuck with me and your feelings get hurt
Then I put you to sleep, take a nap in the dirt
Cause I don’t feel this motherfucker

We in the streets with the 4 wheelers
Don't speak I am no witness
You got beef?
Put an end to you talking like long sentence, period
Motherfucker I'm serious
Who ya favorite rapper, I'm curious?
He ain't living out them words
He ain't used Machine Gun's verse on the track cause his ass got murdered

You talking to a Cleveland motherfucker in the first

Hard not to ball

This that brand new instrumental

Success got everybody hating
Success to me is inspiration

If don't nobody that looks like us makes it?
You only got one life, don't waste it
I mean we only got one night, get wasted
I mean I know you're trying to think it out
But go with what you feel cause real problems can't be calculated
It's hard to find the answer when they have no explanation
It's hard to find where you're headed when there's no destination
It's hard to know when we're going when there's no expiration

Drinking whiskey like a desperado
My bitches drinking Reposado
Ashing in an empty bottle
Listening to the songs that put our asses in this empty condo
Remember ridin' 'round in Ashleigh's car though?
When the radio first played our song though?
Or at her house when MTV first showed my face
That clip was crazy, I swear it felt like we won the lotto
But a million bucks can't buy priceless moments
An a million people may not know us
But every one of us wants this gift we own
And that is: how is how to keep it real
How to never judge somebody by their steering wheel
Cause you know that mother fucker in that Ford Taurus
Could be the next mother fucker in that new Porsche
But like I said it's hard to know where you're headed
When there's no destination

This shit right here, man, this shit feels right! Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it’s all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka, with my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn’t go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over"" cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could’ve died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man I’m not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like “Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now."" I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds."" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called “Chip off the Block” over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: “Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you."" I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes thats all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

Alpha Omega,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,391151,"[Intro]
We not asking mothafuckers to care about us
We just letting mothafuckas know we coming
It's real, it's a real mothafuckin' movement
Whether you like it or not
Whether you support it or not
It's a real mothafuckin' movement, man
It's Cleveland man

[Verse 1]
I am the alpha omega, black flag swinger
Fuck a driveway I’m in airplane hangers
Me and my gang poppin' champagne like players
For all of them days with no lights and no cable
No one can save you, my city’s fatal
Make it up out of it how can they hate you?
C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D’s the greatEST
I'll light this bitch up make it look like its Vegas
We on, mufucka we on
The first one to blow since Bone
Thinking back when I had a back pack full of fat raps
Didn’t no one wanna hear my song
Mufucka y’all wrong, mufucka y’all wrong
Made it and I never left home
Where I’m from enemies bust off their shells like King Koopa
Roll through these streets come up gone like Bermuda
I’m just a boy in the hood like I’m Cuba
So soon as I moved out I bought me a Ruger
You come to my house you blow loud as a tuba
I bring your bitch here, she'll go down like a scuba
All of y’all shits out of style like a scooter
Put all of y’all shits in the ditch like a sewer 
Make all of y’all bow like my name is Anubis
Talk out your medulla get hit with bazookas
[Hook]
(Bitch!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(What?)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ahh!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ay!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

[Verse 2]
If you ain’t living your life then you’re dead
And sleep is its cousin so I shot my bed
Paranoia got me using these meds
Now I'm Smokey as Chris on a Friday like Craig
Retract that statement, I'm stoney as Fred
Evacuate when my homies get mad
You better pray to your God for a blessing
Before they make your world look like Armageddon
Knew I was trouble since I was 11
Ripped up my jeans and I bought me a leather
My friends saw me as a King like Coretta
My dad saw his son as a nuisance, a rebel, and (ahh!)
My music sounds like the devil
Turn that shit off or get out of my temple
Right after that he’d go back to his Kettle One vodka
And drink it all up till he's mental
I have no issue, I am official
Let them come at me I practice Jiu Jitsu
Only fear two things with three letters dawg
That's G-O-D, God and my fucking initials
Doctors called up to the news to report to them what they discovered
Said I’m the first of a species that they call a real muthafucka, (Kells)
And I’m sorry if you get a lot of hits from all my followers
If you acknowledge us in any other way then positive
But you shouldn’t be hollering or talking about Superman
When you're living in Metropolis
And if you follow astronomy I’m a Taurus
That means I don’t give a fuck what you thought of me
I walk into an interview looking like a lobotomy
Flipping my middle finger at everybody who watching us, (uh)
Fuck that bring the beat back
Kill this instrumental leave the body where the reef at
Nah, fuck that where the keef at
Sprinkle a little bit on a quarter of my weed sack
Give me a minute I took a hit I'm tryna focus like astigmatism
My competition on my dick, they're like the zip on my denim
They want the heat I light em up like I put cigarettes in 'em
You bitch, whats your religion?
I wanna know what God you’re seeing in a couple of seconds
I wanna see the criticism bout my lyricism
When I’m in your face rippin' this rhythm up like canabalism
Its Kells
[Hook]
(Bitch!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(What?)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ahh!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ay!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

[Outro]
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?

They start a war if you mention my name
I’m the alpha omega

I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

[Verse 1: MGK]
Looking down at my phone, see another missed call
I'm pissed off, I never had these problems back when I was piss poor
Scared to see my daughter now because I'm lost in the life
In the bathroom getting high when she called twice
Sorry, but I'm scared to look at something so precious when I'm a mess
And her mother know it, I wonder if she ever regrets
Tryna convince my family that I'm only gone for these checks
When really I'm obsessed with getting my revenge through success
Cause people hated on me, how could I not show 'em?
Fans waited on me, damn, how do I not owe 'em?
Imagine having to make that decision
While baby girl's in the kitchen, tears dripping
Wondering where her pop's going
But I never meant to make you unhappy, can I see that smile?
Phone's ringing... ""Aye, yo, I'm with my child""
Anyways, I wanna write you a symphony
But instead she said all I ever wanted is you to stay a while, damn

I know you've been gone, gone, gone

But are you missing me?

[Bridge: MGK]
And hey, hey, hey
It's been so long so you've gone away

[Verse 2: MGK]
Five years to be more specific
I was out here trying to sign to Atlantic
You crossed the Pacific
Now is it a coincidence that my first instrument was a violin
That my father wanted for me, so we ended up buying
And now the instrumental that we're vibing to got one high in it
And while I'm writing my first verse he called me up crying?
That shit is crazy, half a decade with no explanation
Now you're asking if it's too late to save us
Man, I don't know so I hang up without saying nothing, just click end
Wasn't man enough to say it so I wrote with a pen
I just wanted to make you happy, but you never smiled
I just wanted that phone call that said your daddy's proud
Anyways, maybe eventually we'll relive memories
And you'll be next to me and both of us can stay a while, yeah

I'm a Bad Brains, Bruce Wayne in the fast lane
Couple Js in the ash tray, style motherfucker
Tattoo'd back, man see the rap name
Take a bath in the champagne, wild motherfucker
Straight from the block, dawg, ducking shots walking to the store
Dollar for a Black & Mild, motherfucker
Blew up as a rockstar so I'm top floor
Throwing drinks on a cop car, foul motherfucker
The only number calling up my phone
Is from my dealer, swear that dude won't leave me alone
Cause he know when I pick up, I'ma cop a couple zones
And my girl know I ain't fuckin' 'til she roll me up a cone
I be keeping freaks in the home, yeah

Gold teeth like the Nolia
Keep 'em on, yeah

I should be on the cover with my middle finger
Screaming, ""I'm a bad motherfucker""

Kid Rock, that's a bad motherfucker
Young Kells, that's a bad motherfucker (oh shit)
Detroit, y'all some bad motherfuckers
Cleveland, y'all some bad motherfuckers
Okay I'm reaching in my pocket
Got a condom and a hundred dollar bill (uh)
I can snort a rock or I can spend it on a pill (uh)
I be with some models that just flew in from Brazil
And they give me pussy 365 days a year (bitch)
I'm the type to never go to sleep
I'm the type to break a couple motherfuckers' teeth
I'm the type to drop a hit of acid on the beach
And fly to Baltimore and scream, ""Fuck the police!""
Do not get it twisted, this is not an image
There are legends told about the nights I'm in the buildings
It is not a question whether or not I'm the trillest
Every bitch is pressing me to get some cum on their acrylics
1.5 million for my record deal and now I got the feeling
I could finally give a fuck about my parents' marriage healing (fuck 'em)
I'ma buy some mirrors just to put them on the ceiling
So when I wake up I see the realest motherfucker breathing

City of Cleveland man, it's wild man
You know a lot of dudes that get money and it's violence
You know what I'm saying?
I'm part of that product I got 17 and half I've been down for two
Don't call me tase, my name's paper chase, you can call me that
Cause you know I'm known to do my thang in the city of Cleveland
Do a little homework on the hood you know what I'm talkin about

[Verse 1]
Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane
Five Heart Beats left
My homie off of Eddie Road
He thinks he’s a damn chef
Everybody schemed out
Don’t nobody wanna work
I was with him last week
Now I got his name on my damn shirt, (R.I.P.)
Everybody pourin’ liquor
My partner out he beat a case
Took a piss on the fed building
Told them motherfuckers free Chase!
Them boys in the rear view
So now I’m going 25
If they catch my homie in the shot gun, ridin’ with a shot gun
They gon’ give him twenty-five
I’m tryna be responsible
I know they heard I got a deal
They shot the dice game up for five dollars
What they fuck you think they doin’ for a couple mill?
I gotta keep my eyes open
But this weed got me feelin’ heavy
Just like the pistol in my pants
Hate to have it but these mufuckas petty
(In my hood)
All my mufuckas ready
I be rollin’ presidential like Teddy
I might hit the strip club and break a fuckin’ levy
In honor of every hustler that’s locked up in a celly
Fuck it, I might buy the Q Arena for a week and sell it out
Fuck it, I might buy a kilo for the hood and fix the drought
Fuck it, I’ma hold the city on my back when y’all don’t
Come to Cleveland I can get you what you want

(In my hood)
Rappers aren't doin’ shows
Man half them mufuckas hoes (true)
If you got a problem call me
In the land I am big bro
Young man, but I’m standin’ at 6’4”
And SixFo, that’s my man from the east coast
Midwest muthafuckas known to hold dope
85 state side, ATL knows

(In my hood)
It’s clucks at the bus stop
Our billboards got mugshots
Top ten most wanted
And streets where them houses look haunted, (bando)
I told my youngin, “you can make it if you want it”
He looked at me and asked if I saw it coming
I told him that all them summers I was in the basement
I knew I was gonna make it and you couldn’t tell me nothing

Okay, I got a question
Am I loud out there?
I mean, do you really hear me? (Huh?)

[Verse 1]
The definition of greatness 
Is in the making you're witnessing the amazing
Blame me if you awaken
You've been sleeping too long on the one who was chosen mufucka
You're probably unaware but I'm here to let you know it
Take a listen, shut the fuck up for once and just enjoy it: Real Music
Bullshit on the daily? try to avoid it
Your life's ass, similar to a toilet huh?
You see me living chasing everything I wanted, huh?
Forever blunted, ready for whatever coming, huh?
The mailman keep the check coming
The cash in keep the 'vette running
Stop sign? Bitch I run that
Look at where I hung at, 
Bunch of Eastside boys on the field, punt that
Ball 4 life
Give me some shrooms for the serotonin
Me and the crew living for the moment
Everything we wanted is ours
[Hook]
Put me in a fast car, 
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free cause I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I used to dream until I realized it wasn't shit in reality
Cause you can make it happen
And I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen bet you gon remember me
When you see me in that fast car, 
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I used to dream until I realized it wasn't shit in reality

And I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen
Bet they gon remember me
Bet they gon remember me 

[Verse 2]
Damn 
So many people got them hating faces
Like why you mad at me? I’m just out here getting faces
Irritated with these bitches and their crazy ways
When all I wanted was some head on a lazy day, damn 
(Where you been?)
On the other side of the map taking naps in first class getting paid to rap
Paid off having jobs since the seventh grade
Got laid off ever since I've been self made
See my homie want to see me win
Fronted me some bands told me ""Youngin go and get it in""
He believed in it more than I, So I gotta ride
Down to die for my dawgs, yep, EST 4 Life
Opportunity took advantage I gotta manage
Even when it's hard, hard times, yea,  what would I be without it?
The struggle made me tougher, forcing me to hustle
Money in demand, fuck fame ain't nothing but trouble dawg
I'm never perfect, I got flaws like a lot of ya'll
Who be critizing on the low, hating on ya boy
Ya'll defensive maybe that's why I offend you
When I dribble through my legs in the mall when it's time to ball
Life on the edge, hope I never fall
Though you pray I do, what a shame, but I maintain shooting for the stars
Let it bang bitch i'm out of range
And just know I shoot back with my rap name

I'm facing problems everyday
I can’t solve 'em everyday
They want the truth everyday
I’m being honest everyday
I wake up everyday
Smoke this blunt everyday
Go to work everyday
To make a buck everyday
This one for the boy who grew up
Trying to feed his family everyday
(Everyday, everyday, everyday)
This one for the girl who’s feeling lost
Because she's trying to find a way

[Verse 1]
This verse is for my 
People on the grind
Going to sleep at 2
Clocking in at 9
Trying to go to school
That's why you’re at the job
Ask me what to do
When you’re reaching for the stars
Jump!
Everybody scared of a little change
Thats why I’m always looking out for the little things
You should never be ashamed of a little fame
Even Bill Gates back then had a little name
I’m just saying
Y’all know what it's like when them lights go off in the condo
Need a break from the bullshit pronto
Spend your last check on a trip to Chicago
And see your favorite band on the stage again
In your favorite shirt that you made for them
They play the song and you sang with them
Because music heals the soul
And that moment's there so take it in
Before you’re back in that place again
In the uniform that you hate again
Man this freedom for the world

[Verse 2]
I can’t afford to go to jail
Moms' putting their houses up for bail
Court stressed me out
Thinking I need a better route
But all these hoes laugh when I’m ashy
And them boys rob if I’m flashy
And them older folks see my tattoos in their offices and low class me
Man I don’t know what I’m suppose to do
My family is not the Huxtables
I’m just trying to keep my life together
Without breaking all the rules
So I say like five prayers everyday
Until my sins wear away
Let that smoke in meditate
And just chill
Thinking about better days
No more late night belly aches
Use this food for thought everyday
So i will

Merry Go Round,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,110905,"[Intro]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Look...

[Verse 1]
Summer day
Bobby and this girl would wake up every summer day
This boy and girl had nothing, they were runaways
So in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
Never had a silver spoon present in the past
Now at last, the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
Told her bring him a slab, a cotton swab, and a match
And told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
Like “baby I have a plan, come with me to this place
Baby give me your hand, now flip it give me a vein
Baby take off your belt, we’ll use it as a restraint”
She sees that it starts to melt, he reaches inside a case
Fills the needle with food, flicks the needle with haste
Brings the needle to her, she isn’t right in the face
The boy can tell that she’s scared, he says “I love you, okay?”
Then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby?!”
[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round

[Verse 2]
Her dress drops, her head drops
Swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle, he just watches
But he was not Bobby, see Bobby had joined the army
Been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
Everyone of the dealers, everyone hears her squealing
Trading pussy for product, she did anything for that feeling
But then she started that feeling, early morning she’s kneelin’
In front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
That she’s expecting a child
This woman is living foul
She’s only 20 years old
And hardly can even smile
Ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
Sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
News of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
Now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
No mattress, so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
As a letter’s at the door reading:
“I’ll be home tomorrow. love, Bobby”
[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round

[Verse 3]
Knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
Bobby’s nervous, his heart starts to beat faster
He hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
She sold his phone for a hit, damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
But his drug hit her like a cancer
And he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
Passenger seat in his Acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
Under the words ""happily ever after”
He walks into the house, it’s a fuckin’ disaster
Every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
Holds his breath, he knows what he smells isn’t natural
Looks down, it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“Baby please, baby please!!!""
""Wake up!!!”
He screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
Inside was a child
And realizes it was his…
*gun shot*
Summer day, 
An entire family died on that summer day
‘cause a facade made a girl give her love away
But those were Bobby’s consequences that he had to pay
Love is pain
[Hook]

Oz.,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,39975,"[Verse 1]
Early morning cutting corners
Rolling up this marijuana
Stole it straight from California homie what do you got on it?
My cup holder filled with Tropicana
Couple grams of Aunt Jemima
In my hand like candid camera
Vibing to that Country Grammar
Pulling up to Grandma's 
I smell bacon, eggs thats scrambled
Hoppin out then ol' boy ran up
My dog grabbed the mc hammer
*blammer* *blammer*
Make him dance
And watch him run up out their sandals, 
But fuck all that, where's my sandwich
Let's blaze up and change the channels
Look on TV and I see me
With that Chief Wahoo on my beanie
""Wild Boy"" video on repeat
Only white boy on BET
EZ Widers + hydroponics
Roll one tall as Spike Lee
You ain't never seen a muthafucka do it like me
Kells

Oz. in my pocket, ducking the cops

Oz. in my pocket, ducking the cops
Came from the bottom now I get high at the top

Rolling out, smoking up
Cleveland boys don’t give a fuck
1800 fill my cup
Being sober sucks
I'ma spend a hundred bucks on a Oz
Gotta call Big Chuck he the OG
And get a zone for the low cause I’m lil bro
Everybody on the Eastside know me
Westside get it cracking and the fact of the matter is 
Whether I’m standing on Denison Ave or I'm in the Valley
I’m bringing a Grammy back to the city this is the anthem
Have P. Diddy on St. Clair dancing
Kells
Used to ride the RTA
$1.50 every meter
Food wasn’t guaranteed I stole my meals out of Arabica
Speakers blasting my own shit
Bow tie on the jet on my grown shit
Court side at the game with the owner
And sell the same arena out when I’m homesick
God damn I'm a fool
Couple hundred diamonds in the tooth
Couple hundred bitches in the pool
And out of a couple hundred rappers I am the truth
That's why I get a couple hundred when I’m in the booth
Still I keep that

Oz. in my pocket, ducking the cops

I come straight from the bottom
No hot water for showers
Stole a jacket from Target
Gotta go to court in two hours
I’m at Dub's house on Way St.,
Swooped up Slim off of Harvard
Drove down Dove to see Casie
Let's take it back where we started
When I had that

Spotlight,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,113076,"[Intro]
Feel this...
For all that it's worth
To live in the spotlight...

[Verse 1]
What if life was simple as a hug?
What if my partner wasn't crippled from a drug?
What if my other homie never caught a slug?
What if our parents actually gave a fuck?
Another black suit, another black suit
Police happy to see another black shoot
His mother's make up smearing on my arms, 
Crying cause' I'm the only son that she's got now that he's gone
What if the ghetto never heard an instrumental?
And we didn't have this rap shit all we had was metal? 
You telling me if we couldn't shoot a ball
Our lives still got shooting involved?
And what if I never left out of Denver that winter for new beginnings
My father started his business and traded family for riches?
You telling me that my auntie will still have a house to live in
And JoJo wouldn't be writing me from prison?
But fuck it this is life
Deal with it or get dealt with
I'm in my room smoking alone like I'm selfish
Cause' some days the sun's hard to face
Dad turns his son wears his face
But look closer see the heart of a lion
Sticks and stones couldn't damage my bones harder then iron
170 pounds with the walk of a giant
So defiant I pop a Valium, turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
[Hook]
For all that it's worth
To live in the spotlight
All of my demons come to life
And all that it was
And all that it could be
Is lost in the darkness of the night
Why should I die?
(to live in the spotlight)
Why should I kill myself for you?
You'd let me die?
(to live in the spotlight)
You'd let me die inside for you...

[Verse 2]
Look
What if money wasn't part of success?
Would the people I used to be friends with never left?
What if making a name didn't come with regrets?
I think that fame's a pre-cursor to death:
Death of a friendship
Death of a family
Death of a man
The misunderstood are always dead before 'they' understand
Staring at ceiling fans, chop up milligrams, draw a pentagram
Lucifer's not a rumor he's in the band, (damn)
Liquor and vomit on my Converse
Bright lights and packed concerts
And right next to the gun that's on my dresser are plastic orange bottles of peer pressure
And I'm ready to cave, I live in a cage
How can I be a hero when I'm the one needing saved
48 hour days of this fast lane living
Me and my entourage no Jeremy Piven, listen
It's better to burn out than fade away is what Kurt said
I felt the same until I saw his daughter and thought as a father
What if tomorrow; the only I could spoil her was dying?
Started crying then popped a valium turned up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
[Hook]
For all that it's worth
To live in the spotlight
All of my demons come to life
And all that it was
And all that it could be

Why should I die?

Why should I kill myself for you?
You'd let me die?

So what you do when the cop lights
Turn into a stage and a spotlight?
And everyone around you starts to hate cause you got right
And feel entitled like I'm supposed to stop living my life?

Uh, roll another I've been at it all night long
Uh, bedroom, bad bitch, bright white thong
Uh, but she's dark like the color of my heart is
Uh, and I will never love but she fuck me regardless
Uh, I'm in Cleveland if you want to come and witness how a boss lives
Uh, I'm a Beatle to these people like Paul McCart is
(Remember?)
Remember hitting 93rd back to Slim and Dub's mom's crib?
When we ain't wanna hear rappers talk about how their Saint Laurent fits
Bitch I still feel that way people say that way
People say that attitude will get you killed one day
But even in my wake nobody's safe
Cuz ""keeping fake fucks out of the game"" is in my will some way, okay?
Let's not sugar coat it, don't no rappers want it
I'll put the hands to em, they need hydrocodone
Catch me in the morning
Caught up in the moment
On the corner with some youngins that be styrofoamin, turn up, 
I'm advanced with the burn up
25 L's for your man that's murder
22. Cal in the pants, that's murder
Homie let Kells on the track, that's murder
25 grams on the scale's unheard of
Add 3 more, make an ounce, then serve it
Flip it to a chicken, let the town get word
That you whippin that bitchh up in the kitchen like Ike Turner

Gotta keep it trill round here

Uh, In the gutter with my brother up the way bitch
(Uptown)
Uh, Back in Shaker graduated '08 bitch
Shit, I couldn't get A's now a muthafucka A-list
You know a muthafucka dangerous
You know I'm really in the Land with the gangstas 
I'm on Lakeshore heading to the range
With my .40 on some Wu-Tang 36 Chambers
Empty the whole thing then I'm going over to Harvard
I ain't talking about Cambridge, 
If you don't understand the conversation
That's cause you don't speak a real man's language
Can't nobody see me on the Spades
I'm a muthafucking King with the Ace
I be in the muthafuckin city on the lake
Where they never hesitate to put a beam on your face
I can make an eighth flip to a quake quick, shits basic
18, learning all that in Mitch's basement
Big dreams, gotta chase em, stay anxious
Just left Avis I'm driving to the majors
2010 was a paper and a pen
2011 we was touring in a van
2012 was the muthafuckin year I put an album out
Now I ain't never looking back again 
""Let me get a hand, let me get a hand!"" 
That right there is something you will never hear me saying 
Bitch i'm from the C-L-E-V-E-Land
All you see is E-S-T round me man

I've known Kells since I was like eleven. We met in like sixth grade you know what I mean? Kells held me down a lot, my cousin Mikey held me down a lot. And that's really it, people fall off real quick when you're in here

[Verse 1]
Ay tell'em Im'a need a minute, damn
My heads fucked up
I be thinkin' jail whenever hear'em say they need a sentence
I be in the booth zoned out
They say they just need a couple lines
And all the years on the road got me thinkin' blow
Even though they just wanted some bars like jail time
See there I go, somebody take this drink from me
I love my bitches all
Please God don't let them take none of the pink from me
And since you need a filler for the dead space
Sorry I had to get my head straight one of the homies back home caught a fair case
And how I'm suppose to feel
When I'm in Hollywood tryna get a couple mil
And I just got a call that my dawg got killed
And maybe it wouldn't have happened if I wouldn't have been out'chea but
Even still, even back when Dub had a job cuttin' steel
Even back when we was on the block up the hill
On Hundred Thirty-First there was blood gettin' spilled
I ain't re-invent the wheel mothafucka
This is how it is where I live mothafucka
Semis and the blue nose pit mothafucka
Just in case they run up in the crib mothafucka
Got kids mothafucka
Fuck you think you knew about me?
Got a question? I don't even want to talk to you, ask them
They the ones that grew up around me
Kept it one-hundred percent same crew till the end

It's deeper than that, you know what I mean? In so many years and all the shit we been through. That's definitely my brother. I do for him, he do for me. And it was always like that. Ain't shit change. Same mothafuckas we grew up with. We're still boys
He never really been for the bullshit, he's one hunned

[Verse 2]
Ay Im'a need about an hour
And a first class ticket, wait
Make that a jet and a champagne shower
Oh I ain't rich yet
Fuck it I can make a dollar and a dream work
I was on the cover of the double X-L
I ain't talkin' 'bout the big T-shirt
Lace up I'm finna run circles 'round squares in these Nike Airs
Finna go hard with my dawgs that were right there
Finna treat songs like a mothafuckin' pound
And flip an empty house to a mothafuckin crowd
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout ,yes sir
Errbody better pay respect this year
I be in the Land with a steel texture
Object in the waist just in case they test first
Bitch I'm from the east side, east side, watch First 48
I owe nobody, just know I rep, rep OH, get it?
Fuck it if you don't I'm just ventin' like I use to do like these
Rappers I will never mention
How stupid are you?
To think i would give you my attention
When you're nothin' but a peasant and I am a fuckin' legend
Can you feel that?

Once we got to our high school, they weren't teachin' shit. So we would just go do whatever, get some money, whatever. But we were was always good at kickin it though.

Story of the Stairs,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,46981,"[Intro]
And that was a dark depressing time for him, you know
He did had one visit with his mother I think
During the time that he lived with me and she brought
Him a huge box fill with gifts you know clothes and all
Kinds of little goodies and stuff and it sat in the corner
Untouched, literally for months he'd never opened anything just
Left the box there

[Verse]
What's going on in your mind when someone you haven't seen since you were nine is out at your door step right now?
Rewind, remember that one time when Marco showed up at the front door
And we found out he escaped from a psych ward and stole grandma's car?
Ah, rest her soul
I know that's off topic, but I miss her soul
So ironic that she was blind but told me I'm handsome I was
Every time that I walked in the door
Can't lie and say it was easy being 14 on February 14th
Watching a body die in my arms
Then have to go to a school that I hated
When my grade indicate that I don't give a fuck what's going on
A couple hours later on
And not to mention that one bitch that I loved
By the way, I call her ""bitch"" because she was
Wanted me to catch another man fucking her
Invited me over, told me to come into the front
Come upstairs and say what's up
And there she was, little slut
I was broken hearted, should've broke that bitch's jaw
Just for playin' me like a chump
But instead went to the garage, grabbed one
Of her brother's rifles, went outside
And shot that other mothafucka's truck up
I guess that's what lead me to cuffs
Becomin' common in my life like funerals was
Daddy's less common now, he gave up
After he heard the judge pin a fucking felony on his son
Funny enough, me and Aunt Barbara even closer
Start to feel some weight lift off her shoulder
Till it piled back on when a radiologist told her
That she had breast cancer and might not live much longer
Fast forward, the woman that I call my ""mother"" isn't my mother
Or even blood but that's how much I love her
And I'm feeling awkward cause the doorbell's from the person that I call HER
Maybe I ain't ready for it...
Shit, what should I wear?
Fuck that, I ain't going down there
I waited over a decade for closure
Why should I receive it if it might not be something I want to hear
In the mirror is a empty reflection
And in my head are questions I want to ask like, ""Where the fuck did you go?""
Why did you turn my birthdays to the worst days every year that you didn't show?
And if you must know, I didn't turn out to be much else
Than a drunk who fell face first to a pile of hell
Took four snuffs of the devil's dust
Ended up with my manager helping me 'cause I couldn't take a piss by myself
But I did get a record deal
And all my records got that making of a legend feel
And I did have a daughter who I promised that the way that way you made me felt
Is a way she will never feel
Slip a Benadryl in my cup
Ech, fuck it, I'm sickening up
Pit of my stomach clenching, all my muscles stiffening up
I ain't been this nervous since I got jumped
Flick the tip of my J over a surface covered with ashes and junk
Took a pull and sat it down, put on both of my Chucks
Reach for the door but my hand's sweaty, I'm anxious as fuck
Couldn't even hit the stairs without remembering how many years I was there waiting to see your car pull up
Now you saying she's right there?
Man you saying she's right there?
You telling me, if I open up this door right here
That she'll been standing right there?
And after all these years, am I wrong for having this fear
Of meeting the reflection that was missing in the mirror?
Open up the door and then I see her

Hold up
Me and my dawgs so day one
You would think we didn't, grow up
Cause all they say
""The good die young, all the good don't last""
So what? I brought a record deal to the middle of the map
And I still, ain't blow up
Fuck fame, we don't need no one, me and my team pour up
All day roll up, celebratin' every day we don't spend poorer
Hesitation never get a closed mouth fed
Hesitation never booked a ten day tour, but I did, I did
And that was as a motherfucking kid, in the hood I was a young Brad Pitt
Cause I was that shit, and that's when I was hopping on the 19, grinding, plotting on this, so I need that pronto
Dreaming of the view on the top floor, three million views on a talk show
Now I'm finna tell the world who I talk for, this is for the ones
Riding around, smoking that dope
Riding around, smoking that dope
This is for the ones
High cause the flow so dope
High cause the flow so dope
[Pre-Chorus]
If you been a real motherfucker your whole life
Live the hard-knock life and you can't pay bills, shit, that's all right
I feel that
But if you're gonna chill motherfucker, don't hold back, smoke up
And we can live a little bit, cause we ain't worried about shit
We ain't worried about shit

[Chorus]
You ain't living this life though
You ain't living my life
You can't do it
You ain't living this life though
You ain't living my life
I've been through it
You ain't living this life though
You ain't living this life
You can't do it
You ain't living my life though
You ain't living my life
I've been through it

[Verse 2]
Let me talk
I remember you when you were just a teen
Battle rapping on 116th
Take the rapid to the square, I meet B
Posted in the trap with the shrimp for weeks
(What happened?)
I love you C-L-E, that's why I'm trying to take us to the T-O-P
I'm sick of seeing suckas busy, always trying to leech, lucky I ain't never charged a hundred fifty for a feat, 'cause
Everybody want some
Seen me on the television once, think I'm balling but really I ain't got none
Why you think I never changed?
Y'all don't get it
Tell me, how would you feel?
If you went back home and the love's all gone 'cause you always kept it too real
Tell them bum motherfuckers go and get it on your own
This is for the ones who stuck with your boy like glue
One time for the crew, the ones who'd never leave me for the loot, the ones who, if I need, gon' shoot
This is for the ones who smoking that dope
Riding around, smoking that dope
This is for the ones
High cause the flow so dope
High cause the flow so dope

And we can live a little bit, 'cause we ain't worried about shit

Ain't nobody love me as a broke motherfucker
When I was a youngin' from the O, motherfucker
See me on the come up, never spoke, motherfucker
Tell me how you figure that I owe motherfuckers
Now I think about them, man I own motherfuckers

I was just with *beep* in the Ghost, motherfuckers
Y'all need to worry about your car notes, motherfuckers
Aye, can I live?
Maybe I could if everybody put one foot in my kicks

Rhyme and Reason: A Little More Freestyle,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,517,"[Verse: Machine Gun Kelly]
In my hood money equals power
& in the world money controls everything we believe & I can see we're in are darkest hour
Cause It feels like the government is as crooked as the police
I spent the week catching up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied in school
Because some dudes told her she wasn't cool
& You would rather gossip about a famous person breakin' the rules
I'm confused
Tell me is my life's price worth the jewels
They tell me fight night, I'm supposed to loose
Just cause in high sight, They don't like my type
White Boy with some rythem & blues
Kells

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly]
There's a line in there where I said ""A girl committed suicide after she was bullied in school
Because some dudes told her she wasn't cool
& You would rather gossip about a famous person breakin' the rules
I'm confused""
And It really puts a lot of things in perspective with how we are in society right now
Cause we would rather talk about a famous person getting a DUI
As opposed to shedding light on how serious it is that there are boys & girls that are 15 years old, lost, don't have the sense of how to be a man or a woman yet hurting themselves
I was doing a meet & greet & this girl came up to me & asked if I could sign her arm
And I looked down & she had cut her wrist, I mean from about here were her elbow is to her palm
And it was just like gashes
So much pain & I signed my name over it, she took a picture of it & a year later she posted a picture of that same arm & there was no cuts, I mean there was no more pain & It was just scars that will probably never leave
But, It was a beautiful thing to see my voice influence a change like that
We're blinded by all this other bullshit that we don't even focus on the real problem
I mean, I wanna take people's eyes off of the celebrity & put it on the people deserving of our love & attention

4th Coast Freestyle,rap,machine gun kelly,2016,12110,"[Intro]
Ay dolph I had to borrow this beat
My city need me real quick

[Verse 1]
My bitches say I'm nasty than a mothafucka
I hit the jace thraxy than a mothafucka
Vintage frames classic than a mothafucka
Backseat of the uber ashin' like a mothafucka
I be high as Snoop, sippin' gin and juice
Get me drunk I'll stomp yo ass out in these diesel boots
Industry tryin' to change me, but I can't do that
My city miss me so I booked a jet and flew back
Ay fuck yo questions what you askin' bout this mothafucka
It ain't no talkin' it's just action out this mothafucka
Talk bout Cleveland then we taxin' out this mothafucka
We get them Benjamins and Jacksons out that mothafucka
I went from one bedroom apartments to a mansion (whoa there)
I fuck my bitch and we listen to Marilyn Manson (I go there)
They be tryin' figure out how I get all the grams
I say the plug is my mothafuckin' biggest fan
Blow some smoke up in the air, let them know we here
Let me make it clear, don't you ever mothafuckin' dare
Disrespect the youngest bosses up in here, this is not a game
I am just a player, I see all this tryin' take up my career
I need inspiration, I look in the mirror
Pablo Escobar with the yay, I don't sell it I just let'em play
I don't tell'em, they just know what's up
Clean the whole plate, let me fuck
Hit the range on a Sunday, I'm like Rambo with the K
Put some pictures of my haters up
Load them rounds up, let them spray
That's some fucked up shit to say
Oh well, I'm fucked up anyway
Hugh Hefner suite at the Palms
Black suits like it's wedding day
We don't wife shit, we just pipe shit
EST dawg that's for life shit
I'm a livin' legend fuck the hype shit
I'm a livin' legend fuck the hype shit
I'm on my shit call a flight to the grammys
Like give me what you owe me
Lookin' like Cavaliers at the finals
I'm about to get the fuckin' trophy
Ride around the land with my top down
Standin' on the bridge this is my town
4th coast midwest represent (rep, rep)
We don't talk about it, we just rep the shit
Ride around the land with my top down
Standin' on the bridge this is my town
4th coast midwest represent (rep, rep)
We don't talk about it, we just rep the shit

Nothing At All,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,2562,"[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, looking at this map and I don't know which way to go (way to go)
Where I am (where I am), I'm so lost (I'm so lost)
I could've swore that I took this trip with all my friends
Look again and they gone (and they gone), that's the cost (that's the cost)
All I know is that I'm surrounded by all this stress
I'm a mess, they don't see, they don't care, cut the checks (cut the checks)
""Baby you should stop dreaming and get out of bed
Pay the rent"" is what she said, what she said (what she said)
""So get dressed, you don't call, you don't write, and you start and we fight
I have dreams every night of becoming your wife
But tomorrow's a new night, said I hope you do right
But I'm gone cause these calls from these broads that you like (that you like)
Just don't forget that I've been there from the start (from the start)
Don't you dare let this shit tear us apart (apart)
I'm having your child and you left me in the dark
Oh my god, superstar, I swear you've broken my heart"" (my heart)

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Staring out my window, glaring at the snow (at the snow)
Tell me is that the reason why I'm so cold?
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, oh, oh (oh)
Calling up my friends and all I get is the tone (is the tone)
I'm alone, it's so clear this isn't home (isn't home)
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, so I'm gone
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, gone, gone (gone)
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Man I wish I knew when all these things went astray (went astray)
Matter fact, I just wish it could all go away (go away)
And it seems like even on the sunniest day, the clouds come
And the rain falls on my window pane (window pane)
Even if I knew why, what kind of help could I get
Let's face it, what I get ain't paying no doctor's check (doctor's check)
My closest cousin is a schizophrenic, now he gone with medics, and I ain't talk to him since
Ever since that moment, I felt that we been falling apart
First my moms, then I felt my grandmother dying in my arms (in my arms)
And of course how could I forget my pa?
Unconditional love, though we ain't never gon' get along (get along)
What I would give if I could visit my aunt
Every night, every day, but we live so far apart (far apart)
Don't think I forgot you were there with my through it all
You so strong and for you woman, I would give you my heart (my heart)

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Staring out my window, glaring at the snow (at the snow)
Tell me is that the reason why I'm so cold?
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, oh, oh (oh)
Calling up my friends and all I get is the tone (is the tone)
I'm alone, it's so clear this isn't home (isn't home)
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, so I'm gone
So I'm gone, so I'm gone, gone, gone (gone)
[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
Why can't you see that I can't be here no mo' (no mo')
Cause success is a threat to these hoes (these hoes)
I don't have a problem leaving this shit alone
Cut my phone, pack my bags, and never look back at home (at home)
You read about it and I live what they write
I've hit licks, I've been robbed
Dealt with fights, day and night (day and night)
These streets ain't home, they simply gut us too wrong
??? fuck this life
I'm my own man, I gotta keep moving
I don't jump to conclusions because I know what I'm doing
I'm a grown ass man, so accept that
I'm try'na be a father to my kid
So all these haters step back, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chelsea Bowen]
And I don't know if we can make it
Though what they're saying in this game we're playing
Feel like it's one-on-one in a court without a ball
If it was you or the world, I would take nothing at all

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Staring out my window, glaring at the snow (at the snow)
Tell me is that the reason why I'm so cold?

One Night,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,3526,"[Intro: Killah Kalam & Machine Gun Kelly]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Welcome to the Greatest Show on Earth
It is not a dream or reality
It is only known as (Ah, ah)
HOMECOMING (Come on)
Oh, and I'm back, like that (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Blinded by the glare of the green lights, in the street nights
In my eyes now, balling with my top down, roof off, no closed box now
I can hear it in the air like when I stop sound
People looking like I must be lost, if I can't keep a job then I must be boss
And the hustle never dies, so there's no day off
And they be lookin' at the benefits, like ""what that cost?""
Uh-uh, too much for you dawg
Couldn't buy this with the weight that U-Haul
Say you can't stand me, so you fall
[?] it's thanks to ya'll (Thanks!)
Cause now I'm in a different league
Was last, now first in a different scene
Ain't no thug in the kid, I'm a different breed
No couches, just penthouses, this me (Me)
And I'm free so the sky's no limit
I don't know restriction, all I know is infinite
Working round the clock, I don't know no minutes
Ya'll temporary to the game, call ya'll tenants
Then think of ya'll american image & combine it with the graphic lyrics that I be spitting
Then take a ride through the city I'm representing
And see their reaction when they see my face on the upper ending (Damn)
What I wouldn't do for this if I only had 24 to live
Probably take it to the verse, no beat, no chorus, or bridge
And spit it straight from the mouth of the kid, and that's real
I done paid the fee, what's that?
Two whole cities prayed for me, so best believe when I get what I earned
You'll see those names both faced on the map, word
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
If you only had one night, one night, one night
To make your dreams come to life then just keep on fightin'
And reap what's priceless, you want advice?
Then I said, take whatever your vice is
You only live once, we don't get no twices
Smoking, drinking, cars, dices
Do it 'till your body is lifeless
If you only had one night, one night, one night
To make your dreams come to life then just keep on fightin'
And reap what's priceless, you want advice?
Then I said, take whatever your vice is
You only live once, we don't get no twices
Smoking, drinking, cars, dices
Do it till your body is lifeless

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I don't have no regrets
All I got is balls, brains, and a mic, in that sequence
Bad broad coming in the gown with sequence
Doing things to me you'll only do on the weekends
You gotta love this life
Mix the stage with the lime, gotta love that light
They gets on when you bump it, I just call that Sprite
But I'm fly till I die, like a soul plane flight
Yup, infamous, bets on the table all in for this
Shouldn't have waged, I couldn't ride the cents [?]
That's glamorous, no back in the ambulance
And no shots gonna cancel this, no blazing glory just cameras
Besides only two hours to go, might as well spend it all at a show
Only 20 dollars in my pocket, might as well buy some dro
And drink till I'm passed out on the flo'
Grab my hotel key, then I order up a penthouse suite
Room service, with a truck full of bottles and some food to eat
And girls strip like it's New Years Eve (That's what I like)
Only 30 minutes till the Casket
But I ain't stopping, I'm partying till the last breath
Go hard like I know no half step
Not doing the right thing, I gotta go half-cleft
As life scenes surrounding me
People only in the room cause the loud for free
Only five minutes 'till [?] down with me
So I'll make love while falling off the balcony
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
If you only had one night, one night, one night
To make your dreams come to life then just keep on fightin'
And reap what's priceless, you want advice?
Then I said, take whatever your vice is
You only live once, we don't get no twices
Smoking, drinking, cars, dices
Do it 'till your body is lifeless
If you only had one night, one night, one night
To make your dreams come to life then just keep on fightin'
And reap what's priceless, you want advice?
Then I said, take whatever your vice is
You only live once, we don't get no twices
Smoking, drinking, cars, dices
Do it 'till your body is lifeless

Bounce,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,1104,"[Verse 1]
My name is Kid Kells
[?] around my neck I rock jew-els
[?] cause shit sells
I'm another plateau, level so high I see an-gels, fare-well
That's why I walk it like I talk it, and I ain't saying nothing
So I guess that I ain't walking, I'm rolling in that 300
See I ain't no G, but best believe that I run it
I'll talk shit, I'm a hustler, talk money
Bank rolls, stash spots, shoulda, coulda, woulda, them have nots
Pants swole up from them cash knots and my roof lift back like laptops
Who is you kidding, y'all ain't living y'all are scraping
And as long as money talk, I can't hear none of y'all hating

[Chorus]
Bounce, Bounce...and if you getting dough (Yeah)
Bounce, Bounce...and all my ladies know
Bounce, Bounce...'cause I ain't leaving ¡till you
Bounce, Bounce, Bounce
Bounce, Bounce...and if you getting dough (Yeah)
Bounce, Bounce...and all my ladies know (Yeah)
Bounce, Bounce...'cause I ain't leaving 'till you
Bounce, Bounce, Bounce!
[Verse 2]
Stop! Who told you it was cool to mess with this kid?
The city got me paid, so shouts out to my crib
I'm 18 and I got more soldiers than the president
That vanilla drop-top, same color as my skin
BOUNCE! Four-fifteens beat, I make this bass break grounds
This is that [?] that'll make them girls get down
On stage we whilin' until we hear that sound (woop woop)
It's the boys, clear out!
Hit the block in something crucial, polo buttoned up
All of the way up to the top with them fat laces in my Chucks
See I don't give a fuck, never really have
Your girl ain't all that cute, but I'll snatch her just cause I can
Always been the man, never claimed to be the hoodest
Real words couldn't describe me, so tell me who the goodest?
And if music lost its substance, this is hip-hop at its fullest
And if the rap game was a school, then I'd be all you rappers bullies

[Chorus]
Bounce, Bounce...and if you getting dough (Yeah)
Bounce, Bounce...and all my ladies know
Bounce, Bounce...'cause I ain't leaving ¡till you
Bounce, Bounce, Bounce
Bounce, Bounce...and if you getting dough (Yeah)
Bounce, Bounce...and all my ladies know (Yeah)
Bounce, Bounce...'cause I ain't leaving 'till you
Bounce, Bounce, Bounce!
[Verse 3]
Can't nobody get on my level, get up and tell 'em what my name is Kells! (Drop it)
I was pullin dimes when I was a real little boy
And to this day I'm still hollering, still hustling
Still cussing, motherfuck you and the crew you run with
Never been a thang to get off my booty and make them calls and get this money
65 hundred out the trunk, first CD
Look at me now $10 a pop, making millions is easy
Can't nobody see me, and y'all buzzing like bees be
Still hating cause you jealous, y'all just wanna be me
Everything that I do we do the best, get your hating up
Where your money at? Trick please, get your paper up
And I'm in they hood, I must have lost my lid
Fuck 'em says my dirty mouth, I need Orbit
Then I look at my surroundings to find who's hating
There I think I found a putty tat, yup sure did

[Chorus]
Bounce, Bounce...and if you getting dough (Yeah)
Bounce, Bounce...and all my ladies know
Bounce, Bounce...'cause I ain't leaving ¡till you
Bounce, Bounce, Bounce

Bounce, Bounce...and all my ladies know (Yeah)

We took it to the top from the bottom
Adversities, I fought 'em
They never said I'd get it and I got 'em
I am that kid, I am that soul
I am that boy they looking for, I am
I hustle, I grind, I push it, I shine
They know that (I am) that kid
(I am) Kells (I am) Hip-Hop (I am)

Kells! I been that kid since day one
The temptations of this game, the greatest that they saw
They only hate what I've become & that's the motherfuckin truth
I spit the real until the wisdom's out my motherfuckin tooth
And who said I need a coupe? Man I push a hoopty
I'm still the same city boy just new loot
New paper trails and new shoes, new sharks and new pools
See I'm the modern times, you fools is old news
Run the city where the jack is out and every other day
Another motherfucker headed for the top
Came from the box in the bottom of the scene
For the bout to break out Kells cover up then get shot
Can't forget about pops who held me down through all this
The sky's not the limit, all my stars in this bitch
[Pre-Chorus]
So rise (push) Rise (push it)
Grind (let's get it) Grind! (let's get it)
This is my life and I am what they wanna be
This is my fight

Cleveland is the city that we come from
Swear I can't lose with this one
Built Ford tough, call my seven fourty-fizive
M-G-K, the realEST rapper alizive
Fitted from the toes to the cranium
Five star swag from the block to the stadium
I put on my city like a fresh new tee
I'ma hold my dawgs down like a fresh new leash
I'm me, naw matter fact I am, sweeter than blackberry jam
You should already know I'm tweakin off this record
And peaking off the rector
My life is like an epic movie scene with no director

So rise (push) Rise (push it)
Grind (let's get it) i said Grind! (let's get it)

Came from the bucket of chicken and lamb chops
Finger lickin' money made the truck rag-top
More style than a motherfuckin fag got
And the hottest thing cookin since the crackpot
I'm known for making a little bit of change work
Skinny boy known to make a big man hurt
They call me the big bad wolf, all about that green
No time for the little blue smurfs
What's got into these people, speaking my name
You speak what you see and I speak what I live
We are not speaking the same
You are the bitch in the man and I'm the man in a bitch
I'm the brains behind the hustle and the muscle on the strip
I get currency and you heard of me
Machine Gun will murder ??? ca-ca-care for more guap than Burger King
Swear to them I keep it trill until I d-i-e
This is real life for me, motherfuck TV

So rise (push) i said Rise (push it)
Grind (let's get it) i said Grind! (let's get it)

Peace,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,1956,"[Verse 1]
Don't y'all get sick of this regular shit?
Just bought me a new outfit to get a little spit on my dick
I was an outcast till I had no money for rent
So I started counting my singles like arithametics
Then I, stepped up my game like I put my foot on the light
Of the way I wanna get at, told everybody that I had no limit
Fuck privileges we coming out the poorest city
Public subsidized housing, smoke a little weed when they get down some
Money came up short, the crew bouncin
Straight showers in the rough to buy a few mountains
And we, didn't even get over the hill
Didn't even make it through the field
Fuck what anybody throwing at me, I ain't settling for another
And I ain't stopping until I get a meal or until I get a deal
Get it in the streets, they don't need to sweat I got beretta for the heat
Because in the Land there's a dead man
The day I become passive, they all passing me
Actually, naw factually you don't talk, you speak after me
Copied everything I did, let's see if I quit this shit
How are ya'll [?]
[Chorus]
Can I get a little peace?
Peace, peace (that's all I ask)
Can I get a little peace?
Can I get a little...
Can I get a little peace?

[Verse 2]
I'm so close to severing ties with these posers
But these posers hold the power to cut off the path to my career like Moses
Choking cause I'm so sick of being overlooked like telescopes
When I never asked for a hand-out but goddamn can I get a rope or something?
To pull me in from the open, ocean that I've been floating
Those sharks circling my boat, I damn near drowned and seize up, hoping
What's with these [?] tryna be both or they just croaking
Wanna be grown, I ain't ever wanna be MGK always coastin'
Flows always been the coldest, wordplay always been the dopest
My bites always been cobras, me and hip-hop go back like togas
Tell my kids I was a motherfuckin soldier from the time that I was born
Up until the time that I done grown up, keep my boy from off the corner
I don't wanna have a suit and tie for funerals like I'm joned up
Because peace these days doesn't come in nothing but the forms of bullets and comas
And how am I supposed to live life when I'm so broke but
Used to the lavish life, I pray these days are almost over
Focusing on the road to, success and I'm so close but
Struggle blocking my progress, give me strength for Lo, Jehovah
This night is almost over, it's darkest before it's dawner
So please heavenly father, can I get a little peace?
Heavenly father please, can I get a little peace?
Peace, peace

Homecoming,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,1470,"[Veerse 1]
Uh, it's been a long time coming, but I'm finally home
They used to call me kid, that boy is finally grown
Came from the rock bottom, look at how far I've come
Couldn't wait for the day to say father, look at your son
Took what was impossible and turned it to a dream
Until I lost so much sleep it became reality
They say that what goes up, must come down
I'm that ashy, that classy, poster child
So I roll out my red carpet, break out my red garments
Haters wanting my dead, break out my red target
They question what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything

[Chorus]
They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
My heart is all in it, losing is off limits
Reputation matches my attire, I'm authentic
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, tell 'em it's my homecoming
[Verse 2]
I have outgrew so many things, the hood does not fit me
But I can't forget my past, I brought the whole hood with me
Because I love my city, it made me who I am
Tattoo read city boy, but I'm the city's man
You'll never break me down, they wish I was afraid
Out of all the situations I've fought for, you'd think I'd run away?
I count ??? a thousand depths and I ain't hurt yet
Taught how to be a man, but to be a sucka, I ain't learnt yet
So everybody put your drinks up, let's toast to who didn't need no help
Now swing one back for anybody who got one they goddamn selves
I bring it back for the city and they put on for me
We celebrating the beginning, this my homecoming

[Chorus]
They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
My heart is all in it, losing is off limits
Reputation matches my attire, I'm authentic
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, tell 'em it's my homecoming

[Verse 3]
I told 'em what I wanted, what I meant is what I need
It's not just I, it's everyone that's depending on me
I pour my heart in these beats to soar up outta these streets
Pour victory bottles till liquor knocks us out on these sheets
I say it straight faced, I feel it's owed to me
Monopolize like Rockerfeller, that's the HOV in me
My father couldn't even influence my ways
So why the fly-fuck you think I care what a haters gotta say?
I know exactly why they hate, they know exactly why I'm great
They put in work and I work harder, they follow I innovate, YES
I never claimed the title, I was given the throne
Cleveland's American Idol, the king is finally home
[Chorus]
They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
My heart is all in it, losing is off limits
Reputation matches my attire, I'm authentic
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, tell 'em it's my homecoming

[Outro]
Roll out the red carpet, break out my red garments
Haters wanting me dead, break out the red targets
They ask me what I started, I tell 'em several things
They ask me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
Break out the red carpet, break out my red garments
Haters wanting me dead, break out the red targets
They ask me what I started, I tell 'em several things
They ask me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything",en,"uh , it's been a long time coming , but i'm finally home they used to call me kid , that boy is finally grown came from the rock bottom , look at how far i've come couldn't wait for the day to say father , look at your son took what was impossible and turned it to a dream until i lost so much sleep it became reality they say that what goes up , must come down i'm that ashy , that classy , poster child so i roll out my red carpet , break out my red garments haters wanting my dead , break out my red target they question what i've started , i tell 'em several things they asked me what i wanted , i tell 'em everything  they asked me what i've started , i tell 'em several things they asked me what i wanted , i tell 'em everything my heart is all in it , losing is off limits reputation matches my attire , i'm authentic this is my homecoming , this is my homecoming this is my homecoming , this is my homecoming this is my homecoming , this is my homecoming this is my homecoming , tell 'em it's my homecoming  i have outgrew so many things , the hood does not fit me but i can't forget my past , i brought the whole hood with me because i love my city , it made me who i am tattoo read city boy , but i'm the city's man you'll never break me down , they wish i was afraid out of all the situations i've fought for , you'd think i'd run away ?

...

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Congratulations (Hey), welcome to your new life's orientation! (Yesh)
They wonder why they call you baby
When you're head to toe with tattoo abrasions (Why?)
Maybe it's cause I'm in the crib
Louie rag bib conceals my outfit
And when I want, I want real big
And I'm not afraid to scream like Jeezy ad-libs (Yeh)
They like, ""Okay it's time to hit the road Jack""
Fresh air in me, feeling like cognac
A new bounce in me, guess I got the toad back (Uh, uh)
Waving goodbye, knowing that I'll never go back

[Chorus: Success the King]
So I say Good morning, I gotta wash the sleep up out my eyes
Good morning, I gotta get fresh before I step outside
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning, goodbye
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Attention, class in session
Hit the corner store to grab my snack concessions
Cause I, know that I ain't gonna read too much (Nope)
Raised on a grain of salt, I don't need too much
But I, must day dream (Yeah), I must stay clean
??? the soap bar I used this morning
New hood, new walk, new face (Uh)
Sick of all the old miles I ran in old lace
Instead I threw on my Chucks and strolled (Come on)
Waved to the sun with my top down and rolled (Hello)
Pockets bowed, outta my Artful Dodgers (Yeah)
Good day, I'm the neighborhood's Mr. Rogers
Now I'm not against the world
Been long enough now I'm finally by my girl (What up?)
Finally by my dawgs, right beside my team
Good morning real world, I'm outside my dream

[Chorus: Success the King]
Good morning, I gotta wash the sleep up out my eyes
Good morning, I gotta get fresh before I step outside
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning, goodbye

Hello, uh-uh hello
Hello, uh-uh hello

Fuck the police
JP Did This One

[Verse 1]
I just hung up wit the dope man
He just pulled up in the O van
Piece in my pocket click clack
Bitch I don't trust nobody, get back
My tempo is slurred
Twist that hash wit my herb
Mix that soda and syrup
Holdin' my strap like The Purge
Undercovers is the undercovers
Run motherfucker run motherfucker
My homie Tone threw his 45 on the ground
Both got lost and they never get found
Cut through the park stay low, stay low
Hear the pitbulls bark, there they go
I should've went to class this month
But I said fuck that I'm ghost, so
I just rolled up on the dope man
Ay, young gunna, OKAY
[Bridge]
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man

[Hook]
I got my slang from the dope man
I always wanna hang wit the dope man
I learned this game from the dope man
Everybody give it up for the dope man
I got my slang from the dope man
I always wanna hang wit the dope man
I learned this game from the dope man
Everybody give it up for the dope man

[Verse 2]
I just got a scale by the way
Shout out Patty Cake by the way
Told me never put a whole gram in a dime
Give 'em point seven and them fools be fine
But how you gon' sell by the way
You ain't got a clientele by the way
I'ma hit Tri-C wit a couple packs
And if the motherfuckers sellin I'ma double back
Phone ringin more than the operator
And the dealers who deliver gettin all the paper
I spend Sunday trapping on Union
Serving my people like Communion
Can I front 'em a ten? (No)
I am not a friend (No)
Give me money, take this (dope)
Can I get an amen?
Kells!
Okay

[Bridge]
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man
I just pulled up on the dope man, dope man

We gotta make some money
It can help us out with a better car

Ceiling Fans,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,907,"[Intro]
Yeah, you know when you staring up at the ceiling
Sometimes it's hard to figure out what's really spinning
The fans or your mind
Yeah, so what I need y'all to do is
Just look up, tune everything out, and live
Hey, you know

[Chorus]
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans on the wall
Ceiling fans on the wall, ceiling fans on the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans on the wall
Ceiling fans on the wall, ceiling fans on the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow

[Verse 1]
The elevators broken, the stairs second room on the left
I seen my ex on my mattress sucking my dude for a check
She ain't say nuttin while he nuttin', she was in for the money
He in it from the back because even he knew he was frontin'
But you know, can't be too careful
In the hood, that's what they there for
Even your kin ain't your friend, they heart hollow as air holes
That's exactly how I spit it, it's exactly how I live it
Like a drunk man on his gimmick, ceiling fans still spinning
Turn around see the smoke fill up my living quarters
Packing gun shells dipped in water, that's what you go tell your daughter
Opened up the bathroom door and seen somebody shooting up
Peek-a-boo'd out those window shutters seen somebody shooting up
Bam, duck, bust, that's what procedure calls
Not knowing, not being involved but gets you locked behind them walls
I just lost one of my closest friends to the jury
Still, the blades on the fan keep turning, and you know
[Chorus]
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans on the wall
Ceiling fans on the wall, ceiling fans on the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans on the wall
Ceiling fans on the wall, ceiling fans on the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow

[Verse 2]
They say what's up with your lifestyle, you living off a dream
Staring at the ceilings till that lint in your pocket turn into green
How bout the schooling and the college
[?] at the job
But you just scribblin your number, forgetting about the wallet
And I respond to get your own [?]
[?] something like I ran from my home [?]
Just by my lonesome
Bumming off the [?] and let me use the sofa
Gotta keep drumming or this marching band is over, done deal
It's real in the feel when the snake bites don't heal
When the [?]
[?] is all I am, bedridden for months
Staring up the town's sky watching my fans do stunts
18 reflects my age, infinite on my ambitions (Kells)
And 12 will be my greatness if translated into inches
Which means one foot up in yo ass
Biblical when I say don't dance
I'm the Kid, I see y'all but you got [?]

When you living this lifestyle, man
And your whole life's spinning around in a big circle
You just gotta keep focus and live

No Lie,rap,machine gun kelly,2009,1006,"[Chorus]
It's no lie that I make what you want in one day
Go to sleep and I pray then wake up and got paid
So hello to money, all of the pussy [?]
It's no lie that I am who they all wanna be

And I'm that boy
From the city where they gotta lock my doors
Something evil coming out of my floors
Swear monsters creeping out of my drawers
[?]
No lie no I ain't rapping
But I'm in the hood so I wear street fashion
Parents mad my pants is saggin'
Laughing, ha ha, all the way to the bank I'm dashing
Call me the RoadRunner
My whole squad Looney, where's Bugs & Daffy
Strapped to dough like Laffy Taffy
Make me a trademark like Acme
I'm in the outer atmosphere
Gravity's gone, no airplane crashes
25,000 miles per hour, I'm out
And 25,000 dollars that's what's coming out of my mouth
And I grind, I don't skateboard nothing
I rock my Chucks and watch how I turn Superbad like McLovin
It's nothing

It's no lie, that, that I'm, I'm, I'm Kells

[Verse 2]
Garage full of cars with the radar for the laws
And the X-rays for the broads
No telescope, we the stars
Yeah, yeah, sittin on a million but I ain't got it yet
Hey, hey pockets for the [?] like private jets
Got friends from the [?]
Suited up rockin' [?]
Ain't no green from this side of the fence
So we drop the bills, picked up the personal checks
Yes, show 'em where the loot at
Matter fact, show them where the recruit at
Billionaire's Boy's Club, I'm the newest
God bless [?] I'm the truest
Come on, I got a net worth larger than the average American citizen
Focused on my money, hand me forms and send em in
Hustlin [?]
Only medicine that a guy like me needs is that gwap and no lie
Will be the one to cross the finish for the spinach and I am that guy

It's no lie that I make what you want in one day
Go to sleep and I pray then wake up and got paid

Off the wall like Cat in the Hat
Mad rappers got a pack in the bag
I'm a white boy, say hello to Cracker Jack
I was Chevy Chase to Caddyshack
This game can't handle that
Unless you wanna come in my habitat
Running your mouth cuz words don't hurt
[?]
I got [?], old skits but fresh to death like coffins
3 out of 4 of them got hung gardens
With vegetables that'll have you coughin
Wallets not thick yet but my mind state is rich and I'm [?]
Penthouse, rent out, new shows, I'm gone
I don't come home too often
Look up to the Milky Way
Saw me in the sky two days
Like male pattern baldness, stars is falling
But I got my toupee

Dessert, now where's my souflee
Got the pot, I spit one verse and burnt the house down like Lisa Raye

Chill Bill remiXX,rap,machine gun kelly,2016,21616,"[Hook: Tezo]
I be on it all day
Like Big Boi and Andre
Smoking on that kill bill
That shit keep me high for days
Treat a bitch like Postmates pull up
Paint her face then vacate
Spending money LA, California vacay

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ay, gold flakes on my steaks
Vodka in my Perrier
I don't have no table manners
I'm a savage every day
I don't cry but I smoke onions
I fuck bitches up at Runyon
My squad just bought machine guns
In case you haters up to something, boom
Woah, woah, dude wait
The crib looking like SoHo UK
Big budget finna ball like 2k
I got a boutique in my closet
Big booty bitch making me coffee
And the crib speakers only play vinyl
I got the Fugees killin' me softly
Gold chains on my dick
Feeling like 2Pac in this bitch
Feeling like Scarface in this tub
Feeling like Snoop Dogg smoking this nug
Tatted from the toes up looking like a thug
Eyes all red, got 'em looking like blood
Take a piss test, it'll look like drugs
If I take a piss test, it'll look like drugs

Meet my nigga on water

And that pussy gorgeous
I'm a fucking savage
Might slaughter your daughter
Ho, I'm God's son
I wanna be my father

[Verse 3: Dub-o]
I am on a higher level, cloud 9 and one
Holy moley, slow your rolly
I'm hot bitch, cut the fan on
I should put some Vans on
Make Dane tell me damn dog
Doobie stogies I be burning
I smell like I was burning
My bitch look like she could be Spanish
Every time we fuck I fuckin' vanish
Peter Pan Neverlanding
The heater man, blam the cannon
Bring it back like DJ Cannon
Save the drama, baby momma
Cause I am not the baby father
By the way I know he hate me probably

Just What I Am RemiXX,rap,machine gun kelly,2016,11691,"[Intro]
9:56 am
Roll the windows down
Let the smoke out, aye
Wake and bake, bitch

[Verse]
Aye, I'm just what you made god
I been high as fuck
Since me and my homeboy A-Rod
Was in Tower City, tryna catch that bus
We out here, what you need?
Back in Shaker, baggin' tree
Baby mama call from the college
Said them kids wanna pay the fee
I'm up early in the morning
Smoke in public, my trap is jumpin'
I made two hundred, that count for somethin'
I pull up get them Lil Debbie muffins
I'm out here, on my daughter
Whiskey, weed, and water
Just beat that misdemeanor last week
Need new money for the lawyer
I need new carpet at the crib
God damn this roach is where I live
So dope, put some groceries in the fridge
Young man, just hope that God forgives
Fast forward, old hoes knockin' on my door
Askin' where do I be at now
Smokin' loud on my tour bus
Famous bitch in my back lounge
I done blew up past rap now
And it feel good, bitch I'm from the hood
So I lived a life I that I should you, hoe
Get the shit understood you, hoe
Came in this shit as a kid, you know
I ain't Cudi, but that's the buddy
We in Coach party, talkin' Cobain
Smokin' hella Js, out in London
No beef at 16, I've known Chip since 16
Call Ben Baller, told him we need custom
Diamond Cleveland championship rings
We need all of them big things
Just 'cause we deserve it
Just 'cause the ones who fucked me over
All need to see if it was worth it
Damn, old homies switched up on me
Why am I not surprised
Lookin' at me like I need to share the piece
When they weren't even there to make the pie
Man that's why
Yeah, yeah
Fake friends fuck them, right though
Ay fuck a fake friend, get high
And talk to god dawg mutha fucka
[Hook]
Let me tell yall about my month y'all
Codeine in my blunts y'all
Like why the fuck did I smoke the shit?
Fell asleep and never woke up from it
But whatever, that man ain't wearin' my denim pants
And these long, long nights on all this cocaine
Ain't workin man

[Verse 2]
So, what am I to do when the game is so fake and I am true
And my city just got the W
And the number one spot is vacant too
And I think my foot might fit the shoe
And I think my glass is lookin' full
And I know my daughter so proud
Tellin' kids my daddy got a pool
And I can't stop smilin' at the crib
I can't stop frownin' out in public
I got this paparazzi on me
I see these rappers actin' funny
I see them stealin' what I did
I see them pimpin' out the culture
I heard the game missed the kid
Dear hip-hop this what I wrote y'all
Just what I am
[Outro]
Young kells in this muthafucka
Young gun in this muthafucka blam, aye
For my city though, for the game

That is me, huh

And over my head, out of her head she sang

If anything could ever be this good again

I go to sleep in the morning, and wake up when I wanna
I am my own employer, I be high off marijuana
Shit I might start my day off at the crack of 6:00 PM
And spend per diem on 24 hour breakfast, look
8 plates, and you can’t have a taste
Only bosses keep a bong inside they work place
I just wanna eat some mushies in the Mercedes
Trippin' down Venice like a menace 'cause of earthquakes
I need a dentist 'cause I chipped all of my teeth on the tour
Probably from all them nights of passing out on the floor
Took some acid in Minneapolis, that was with Mod
And got locked in the freezer, I swear to God

Tim Westwood TV 2015 Freestyle,rap,machine gun kelly,2015,5272,"[Intro:]Uh, hey yo, Imma make this verse outta every artists name who inspired me in the game, see if ya'll can count how many I name

[Verse:]
Uh, Kells
They don't wanna see a real muh'fucker winnin'
All the greats died but there's still one livin'
I spit reality when all the music nows gimmicks
It's kinda foul to see that what we do is all image
But I really live this, Jimi Hendrix 'till my lyrics hit 'em
Then Bob Dylan asked why I ain't on the television
Cause a premonition of John Lennon said the second you preaching the message is the minute you Zeppelin
That means on the stairway to Heaven I go back to the two family homes
Where my daddies cologne would cover up the fact we Rolling Stoned. I got places to roam, reading through a text on my phone from Billy Joe, saying 'You are the next Joey Ramone.'
Smoking Chili Peppers outta bong, Kiedis recognized the tattoo on my arm said Flea and em' told 'bout my songs
I turn around ""What's it gwan' Bob?""
Getting gnarly with Marley, smoking barley, trippin' in the party with Steve Jobs
And they say ""we need marriages in our lives"" fuck dat!
Tell my bitch ""I'm with Marilyn tonight.""
Ringside yellin' to Muhammad, during the fight
Sittin' next to BIG and Puff, Bad Boys for life!
Black flags and dice, hashtags and flights, ripped pants and Nikes, a black pen and a mic
Cleveland my city, I tatted dat for life!
Real people with me, haters hashtag and type
Trashbags and fights, we fillin' this motherfucker
Me and hoes buying bottles we spillin' this motherfucker. Heard Nas even bought Lauryn Hill in this motherfucker
Like, good goddamn they filling this motherfucker!
Pac said ""I live the Thug Life.""
Aaliyah on my arm, boy I got a Thug Wife
Drunk nights with, Nikki Sixx, now he's on a heroin binge
Me and Morris are snorting anything we touching again!
An, Imma, Sex Pistol, everything I Sid Vicious
I'm making Johnny Cash haters eat my Limp Bizkit
Fuck with it or Gorillaz your decision
But I Will Smith & Wesson anyone of my opposition
And all these critics reframe from speaking my name
And these newer artists feel the same, they Nicolas Cage
Mean they Gone In 60 Seconds, get up out my way
If I ain't critically acclaimed, you're clinically insane
Bitch I ain't ashamed of where I'm from
I'm not ashamed I'm not a trophy fathers, trophy son
I'm not ashamed I got a daughter and support her instead of being a baller flaunting every dollar
Bitch I'm barbecuing cus I'm A1!
I can't front, this life we live is a blessing
Dreaming about the Future but everyday is the present. Whether they accept my music or they try to forget us
Here forever, bitch I'm a motherfucking living legend
Feel that! Uh, yeah this beat, I killed dat
Kanye made the beat let him heal that!
Uh, uh, let him heal that
Uh, uh, let him heal that
Yeah, now they say ""Jesus walks"" and I say ""I'm so high I can't hear Jesus talk.""
Uh, Tim West, wassup?

At My Best,rap,machine gun kelly,2017,505682,"[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Turn my vocals up, alright

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best
[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...
Aight check this out

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Life is about makin' mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best
[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly + Hailee Steinfeld]
This song's for anybody
Who feels like I did, never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through, always remained true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it, the one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ohh, I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Go for Broke,rap,machine gun kelly,2017,64839,"[Chorus: James Arthur]
You could get high or you could get low
You could stay young or you could grow old
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke
You could go hard or you could go home
You could live life or you could just fold
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I started with a dollar and a dream, right
So I can show these people how to dream, right
I could show 'em how to aim for the stars
And take it to the arenas from the street lights
Damn, oh this is what the top feels like? (Whoa)
I still remember Ramen noodle meal nights
I still remember checkin' my account
And having 26 dollars when I signed my record deal nights
And I remember being cold
In my apartment, used the heater from the kitchen stove
Highs and Lows, that's how it goes
So I gotta roll somethin' up
Just to cope with the pressures of growin' up, man
[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
What a week
We made it to the bar 'cause we need to heal up
You gotta play for keeps
'Cause Aces tend to stay with dealers
You got to believe it
But I'm a sinner too so I ain't preachin'
Just keep on dreamin'
'Cause all the bad days come for good reasons

[Chorus: James Arthur]
You could get high or you could get low
You could stay young or you could grow old
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke
You could go hard or you could go home
You could live life or you could just fold
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, and if I had a dollar
For everytime they told me what I wouldn't be
I would be a rich man with a crib on a big hill (for real)
But I gotta work to get paid
Earn my own way
Work the third shift, burn the whole spliff
Since birth I've been... (Hold up, let me get it)
Look, failure was not an option, I gotta be at the top
Like I'm sorry, but I don't really feel sorry for y'all
I'm sorry I got a new number that you can't call
I'm sorry to everyone who still wants me to fall
Hold up, you know what, I ain't sorry at all
[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
So I, hope that it was worth it when you searching
And you find what glitters ain't gold
And I, knew I wasn't perfect but I know that I made it all on my own

[Chorus: James Arthur]
You could get high or you could get low
You could stay young or you could grow old
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke
You could go hard or you could go home
You could live life or you could just fold
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke

[Bridge: James Arthur]
Paid my dues, so I'll see you later
Life is much more than paper
So I let it go, I just hit the road, I just let it go
Yeah, paid my dues so I see you later
Life is much more than paper
So let it go, I just hit the road, I just let it go

You could get high or you could get low

And if I must go and die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Now, will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive inside forever
And feel me forever
They say I need to slow down, but I don't know how

[Verse]
Yeah
Real feelings from past dealings
When people counted me out 'til I grew up to count millions, uh
Like I guess it's good to be different, huh?
I'm a star so the sky isn't the limit, huh?
I'm living like it's my last day
Smoke as if there's not already 27 roaches in the ashtray
Smile as if no one hated at all
As if anyone understood anytime I evolved
Tell me, what do you do when what you dream comes true?
Buy a Bentley and look just like you?
How am I supposed to write a song when I'm famous
And all the pain is created?
I need to overdose on inspiration

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you just go home?
Well, I can't right now, I'm a rolling stone

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
And if I must go, and fly away
And kiss my baby girl goodnight
And if this really is goodbye
Then let's set the city on fire
Can you take me higher?
Now, can you take me higher?
Now, can you take me higher?
Can you take me higher?

[Post-Chorus]
If I must go, die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever
If I must go, die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever
[Outro]
I let these words seep through my soul
And speak through the song
'Cause if one day, I'm no longer here in the physical
Then at least I give you my voice to listen to
What is a beautiful life without a beautiful death?
What is a beautiful mind, how is our beauty defined?
Is it for you to decide, is it my duty to die?
No matter how I'm remembered, just let me be remembered

Pull up, back home, flag on, tats out

Been around the world, I'm back now

And I'm running the streets of the city like Rocky
Who da champ? Who da champ?
Diamond fangs like a vamp
Where's the package with the stamp?
Bust it open by the lamp
Roll it up 'till I cramp

Smoke rings from the grams, uh

Walk up in the spot with hella reefer on me
Pockets full of what?
Hella quarters, like I'm 'bout to feed the meter
Only two seaters, I mean two chiefers
We ain't even parkin'
We just spark it and fly frequent
Up in the sky, Jesus
Gave me high fives, Peter
Pan full of yams
Trees lit like Christmas Eve
I'm so facetious, so indecent
Fuck the world and leave it speechless
Rock that jacket with the cheetah
Look like Elvis with these sequins, I'm sayin'

Roll up, my nigga, what's the hold up, my nigga?
Smoke until my eyes red as Coca Cola, my nigga
Where I'm from you get popped, that ain't soda, my nigga
Got a bag full of green like some groceries, nigga

Yeah, fast life, hash pipes, lit up like flashlights
Fast cash, back scratch, steal off on last night
Super stoned, where is home? I missed the last flight
Aww man, hella saucy, I got the last bite

Tank full, goin' to the moon

Ain't nobody realer than us
Ain't nobody triller than us

My walk is so cocky the bouncers don't even stop me
Ain't no pat down, no ID
They know me, that shit obvi
Bitch I pack out the lobby just from fans tryna find me
I got daughters and mothers tryna fuck with the gunner
Two tone suit like the Joker
My Harley Quinn wears a choker
Let them suicide doors up
So much smoke, can't photo us
I'm out west like the gold rush, 1942 poured up
I ain't spent one night sober since I turned 20 years old
But I'm on my Jeezy in 2005 ""Trap or Die"" shit
That everything 100, this ain't no facade shit
This that ""Look me in my eyes and don't you fuckin' lie"" shit
Still don't need no opinions
Bitch, most these artists my minions
Whoa
Yeah, turnt
Any weed around me finna get burnt
No lie, I'm on fire
Hogtie anybody need a realization that they fuckin' with the wrong guy
I am the Alpha Omega, came from Sonic on a Sega
Crumblin' chronic on the table
Mumbling lyrics in the basement
Like I'm finna go Super Saiyan
I'm saying, I ain't have a plan coming out the land
Hanging with my man, tryna slang a gram
Just to rent a van, just to try and tour
Turn some common clothing in to couture
Still muddy from the sewer
Look at all that I've endured
All them years I couldn't afford
Friends thats in the morgue
We are not the same, say the fuckin' name
[Chorus]
I am the gunner (The gunner, the gunner)
I am the gunner (The gunner, the gunner)
I am the gunner (The gunner, the gunner)
I am the gunner (The gunner, the gunner)

[Verse 2]
Let's do this for real
Super sonic, super sonic
Psychedelics and some chronic
Still remain the trending topic
Five movies, let's be honest, what you call it?
That's a major motion picture wallet
No, I do not want to comment
Don't approach me, I am violent
Snapping pictures 'cause I'm styling
Let me make it very fucking clear who I am
Do not start assuming, let me clear confusion
I am not a human, they call me a giant
I pick up the mic and I start a riot
I spit a verse and I change the climate
Fuck a dealer, man, I need the pilot
Drop the weight off like he on a diet
Hanging off of the balcony of the Hyatt
I started with one, then I multiplied it
Now I got me 3 women like Frankie Lymon
And I got me a double X made in diamonds
Bitch, the dynasty never dying
Someone ring the sirens, I just broke the silence
I just sparked the loud up, who the fuck can stop us?
I resort to violence, no resorts and islands
You know where to find us
[Chorus]
I am the gunner (The gunner, the gunner)

Kiss the Sky,rap,machine gun kelly,2017,87159,"[Verse 1]
See I've been searchin' for somethin' out there
When is it comin'? Tell me
What to tell myself
When I drink so much that it hurts my health
'Cause I stay up way too late
And I owe a million favors
I can't overstress myself
So I wrote it down to express myself
I'm lookin' in the mirror tryna find
Peace of mind in a piece of my
Inspiration back from the beginning
Life's a movie, I can't make revisions
Ate an eighth of shrooms and started trippin'
Had some visions that were nonexistent
I think I just left the solar system
Doesn't matter, I still kept the rhythm
Diamonds still gon' light up like a prism
That's from years of grindin' independent
What was at the bottom now has risen
If this isn't Heaven then what is it?
Always real but never realistic
Want the world but nothin' in specific
Don't need shootin' stars to grant my wishes
I'm a superstar, let's go and get it
[Chorus]
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the sky-y-y-y-y-y-y

[Verse 2]
Now can I, lay underneath you?
While they play all the previews
And I'll pretend like I'm restin'
Maybe you'll skip to the end and
Pass all the irrational decisions
Patch up all the passion that was missin'
I think that's enough, I'm feelin' lovesick
Rollin' loud, I'm on some turnin' up shit
Paid a couple hundred for a high that I couldn't get on my own (on my own)
And I've been lookin' for a long time, but I never found home
Everything is alright, I'm around for the long ride
Go get drunk and find some trouble (ayy)
Add some pieces to the puzzle (ayy)
Couple rights, couple wrongs
That's the prequel to the sequel (yeah)
And all the space in between us
Are memories that we conceal
The jagged edges of a pill
Remember what it is to feel
Windows down behind the wheel
Gotta do it for the thrill, watch me
[Chorus]

Ay, red light's on in the Boulevard
That means business
Throw up in this bitch, I might
Corny bitches make me sick
I might throw up in this bitch, throw up in this bitch
Gunna

[Verse 1]
Made man like Joe Pesci
I need Deniro or I'll Rob her
I had to skate Wayne Gretzky
Called an Uber helicopter
Bought a pound for the roster
Bought the yayo from Miguel, though
Award shelves need an Oscar
They need my merchandise on Melrose
David Bowie of my generation
Kill the Moët bottle with no hesitation
Came from public education
Ramen noodles with the bacon
I was working at Chipotle, I was finna have a baby
Went from stealing out of Walmart to president of operations
Dub was working at the steel shop
Slim was working off of 1st block
We still roll together every day
Except we might be on a private plane
Why would you ever come from nothing
And not do whatever the fuck you wanted?
They be asking why I'm such a legend
I took so much acid, I be forgetting
[Hook]
I'm a golden god, I'm a golden god
I'm on the roof of the party
Still almost famous, still all the way dangerous

[Verse 2]
Still dirty Chuck Taylors, still hanging with gangstas
The type to put the red beam on you, I ain't talkin' 'bout a laser
We the golden squad, we the golden squad
Double X, we the hardest
Me, Dub-O, Mercy Marty
Should've never got us started
Motherfucker, I'm retarded
Do you know how I'm regarded?
King of underground, King of Cleveland town
King of marijuana gardens
I can't stop myself from coughing
Four thousand dollar bong rip
Custom made for the new house
Can't believe I never had shit
2012 was a good year, 2017 too lit
20/20 vision, see the future
Looks like the crown do fit
I am king of this new shit, 7 rings and a pool stick
8 ball, and a suede robe – rockstars don't say no!
This beat so flame, though; I forgot to say my name, though
Bitch, I'm G-U-double N-A, Gunna!
Never like my mother, fighter, not a lover
Man, I'm wildin' every summer
I ain't like my daddy, he religious
I'm with bitches burning rubber
I'm a desperado, whiskey bottles, .38 bang, bang, bang
Models be on the same thang, thang
EST, that's the gang, gang, gang

I'm a golden god, I'm a golden god
I'm a golden god, I'm a golden god

Yeah
Can we please start over, now that we're both sober?
Even though that won't last long
I swear this love is a sad song
I spend my nights at the strip club
I pay them girls just to get love
I pay them to lie to me
One of them girls gave her line to me
I spent my night at the strip club
I pay them girls just to get love
I pay them to lie to me
Girl I can't even lie

Don't cover my scars, let them bleed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to be?

Even if the highs feel low
Even if you couldn't sleep because you couldn't feel me underneath the covers when your eyes closed
I'm gettin' faded 'cause our love is fading
If I'm a monster then it's 'cause you made 'im
Beauty and the beast, now that's an ultimatum
Go with what you love, or follow what is gonna save you
Woah, I think we went somewhere we shouldn't go
Maybe it was Vodka, maybe it was blow
Maybe it was nothin', maybe it was both
Maybe it was the secrets I ain't want you to know
Maybe I wasn't leavin', maybe you made me go
Maybe there was a reason for our behavior tho
Maybe it was the pills or the house on the hills
Maybe it was the thrills, baby this love kills

Let You Go,rap,machine gun kelly,2017,159766,"[Bridge]
Since you left, I've been holding on to a memory
Since you walked out that door (Yeah)
And you said I changed and you're so damn sick of me
You're not mine anymore, 2-3-4

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I still remember what you wore on the first night
Still remember how that black dress had your curves right
Still remember smokin' just to calm my nerves
'Til you had to leave and grabbed your purse, I grabbed first
Uh, it's no words, yeah, it's just her
Body against mine, makeup on my shirt
Lipstick on my neck, whiskey on my breath
Taking pictures in the moment so we don't forget, yeah
[Chorus]
Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore

And I can't be myself without you
I am not well
Okay, I said that before but
I need you now, yeah

Tell You Somethin,rap,machine gun kelly,2010,1110,"(Verse)
Damn, (Peter Parker) 16 not a kushy in the jar take a hit now I'm floathig next to Pluto
Super bad, used to dream one day I'd be a star, Hollywood big screen like Juno
Yeah, so I hopped up out the bed
Said fuck school layed at the crib
And lived every single punchline that I have ever spit
Cause reality to me is behind my eyelids
Gone, and don't mind my ad-libs
A lot of these rappers young but I am that kid
(Kells) That piff, chillin' in the hood, light it up
Now my minds in the heights like where my dad lives
Can't hate though, not at all man
I'm in the stadium and I am not a ball fan(No)
Or a ball player, just freshman with a team, now let me ball hater
(Swish) Leaning, give me my balls hater
Jealousy took over their lives, I'm the cause hater
And the most 10th graders want my autograph paper
Meanwhile my bread comin out the cheese grater(Ha, bitch)
Yeah, I am the greatest
So bad when they need me, they be saying tsk tsk
Boy, I'm raw as this fish in the sea
See me, get off my bitch's dick
At the cornerstore, heavy dog
Pull up in the lot, open doors, see heavy fog
All I needs a brownie, Arizona and a funyon
Plus a hotdog, extra relish got the munchies like a muhfucker
Blaze up till you face up
Got the hardest bars in the game, step your cage up
100 words and runnin', you better lace up
If you can't tell I'm a star, step your knowledge of space up
Uh, Gangsta? Nah I'm fuckin' with ya
All my girls back in Shaker, yo what's up with ya
Up in their blouse, boyfriends couldn't trust me
Couldn's stay in the house because the streets love me
And everyone who hated just mad they couldn't become me
Ain't it crazy I'm celibate when everybody says fuck me
Probably cause they think your boy musty

Look, you wanna know who's in my top ten?
Me, me, me and me again
Run and tell them that it ain't pretend
No fake news, CNN
Run and tell them that I lay the pipe
All my exes still sprung
That must mean the double X's on my chest ain't the only thing hung
What did I do to deserve this?
I can tell you if you listen
The difference is you a gimmick, I earned this
Someone give me some detergent
I just came out of the mud
Wipe my sneakers on the rug
No ID's for the club
No idea where the stash is, hidden pocket for the drugs
Tell the police suck my dick like sluts
I will not budge
Nor will I trust, I am rich like Russ
I used to grab my daughter from her mothers house on 112th and Dove
They tried to kill me in my dad's truck
I had a 40 in my pants tucked
You know I am from the land of
Young killers, no manners
Put the purple in the fantas
Eyes red like Santa's
And now a driver pulls the van up
Now they watchin' me wit' cameras
Had to shut down the campus
All the way to Los Angeles
See ya'll got me on some trash
Got me speakin' on the past
Like I wasn't on a private jet with Dan Gilbert gettin Kyrie at the draft
Like I wasn't shining on my XXL freshman class
Like I needed these collabs
Just to get these plaques
No, I got plenty of 'em
Man I'm solo on many of 'em
Y'all know I changed rap
Live shows I changed that
Mosh pits since way back
My guitar, I play that
Ya'll witnessing a rock star kissin' on a pop star (Haaa)
Power. I bloom, no flower
Swisher Sweet full of sour
That's a juxstaposition
Shut the fuck up and listen
Just to meet me in the present is a present
Meet me for dinner at seven, a celebration is in order
Book me a table at Beauty & Essex
I don't need the menu neither
Bring me some Yellow Tail and tequila
Used to eat Taco Bell every evening
That's what the fuck I was doing in Cleveland
Aye, worth the wait
Third album on the way, y'all know I slay
I shotgun pump, I don't pump brakes
I'm my favorite rapper alive
Since my favorite rapper banned me from Shade 45
I wonder, what now?
It's the Gunna (click clack, keep going?)
Look, ya'll don't gotta hear shit, ask anybody in the 216
If my name rings bells in them bricks, everybody know who that is
So what you hate boy, you late boy
You ain't heard about that great boy
The 3 letter name caucas' boy
Used to live right there up the way boy
Man you heard about him, said the name
Saw the iTunes and clicked to play
You liked the shit and then bought the shit
And put 'em on a playlist right next to Jay
Yo girl saw me and I signed her tits
Disappeared, you couldn't find the bitch
And your heart stopped, you know what time it is
Aye her man called me like
Be humble, not now

INTERNATIONAL HATERS ANTHEM,rap,machine gun kelly,2011,1082,"[Intro]
Yeah
This joint right here is dedicated to all the Machine Gun Kelly MGK haters out there
We call this one ""International Haters Anthem""
I cordially invite you to enjoy the four features I have on here
Of myself, Machine Gun Kelly
A yo Dante, they say them Cleveland boys don't got no heat

[Verse]
Shit, bitch you know I never gave a fuck
Oh damn, my bad
Can't say shit when I'm in my Jag
Words gonna slur when I hit that gas
When it's too fast
Came up on a little bit of change, quick cash
Haters wanna see me fall quick like ash
Grams are less 'cause I bounce back
Diamonds in my chain, yellow like cab
Save another peddle break 'em off, Kit Kat
Hoppin' out the bedroom for money and big bags
Fuck you, hatin' on Machine Gun Kelly
Kelly gonna get you, body bag
Might have a little rope in the trunk
I'm in the Cadillac
Killer Kels, hip-hop's back
Mwah, pucker up, kiss my ass
Personally I like the distance between us
Take a look over the buildings and see the Caribbean
Chick is what I be swimming in
Record officially eating
CD shelf me-e all day-um
""I choose you"" what they be singin'
My net worth is multi-million
You yourself is barely eatin'
Eenie miney mo' money
Said fuck the streets let's hit arenas
Packin' money in the small cases, just like misdemeanors
I'm felonious
Money stretching out longer than my penis
Hold up, what the fuck you wanna take a flick for?
Laugh more
People just sayin' I couldn't spit though
That wasn't my car, that was a rental
See me roll up with the stars now I'm the shit, oh
Ok, that's how it is though
Bitches wanna hit up a dude just 'cause [?]
Then you found out about the flow like a pitbull
Now you all on my dick like a nympho
Here we go
Being rushed but I'm pretty, ho
First they acted so diddy though
But now they all in my video
She ain't shit, she just pitiful
Ain't no dime, she a penny ho
Mouth closed, open this close only talk when Machine Gun Kelly's home
They said my info 2-16-26 like Goddamn I'm a pimp
My magic stick ain't 'posed to poke her, wanna loosen up your grip
I'd rather limp than be a wimp and spend my ends up on a bitch that crimp
Gamers in my sport so I ain't never had to pitch, get it
Get a clip and put a tip into your baby momma's hip
Because my clique do the dirty work and I collect the chips
I'm 'bout more money, what's a hater though
I'm focused on more whips, I ain't a faggot
Tell them dudes to get they lips up off my dick, bitch
[Outro]
By God, I've done it again there Johnson
Hey, nah man this is for all my Cleveland people out there
Doing their thing man
Keep grinding, let's get it
Once again, it is your favorite white boy rapper

Numb,rock,machine gun kelly,2017,12419,"[Linkin Park cover]

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge]
And I know, I may end up failing too
But I know, you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

The Break Up,rap,machine gun kelly,2017,363171,"[Verse 1]
Girl I know
I know you bought me the watch
You ain't get it back though
My name's on the back though
I flipped the lock to the back door
And took the key under the mat though
I know you hate that
But you did some things that you cannot take back
I needed change
Left a nickel for a dime
That is a payback
""What you sayin?""
Bitch I'm over you and I ain't playing
Should've been a one night stand
But here we go again....

[Chorus]
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

Please never call me
Do not mention me in any stories
Do not show up at the homie's party
Come up to me and then say I'm sorry
You're just a
You just a — hold up let me stop
The Henny shots got the petty talk comin I don't wanna have them thoughts running
Can't believe that I bust in a thot's stomach
Fuck is wrong with you
I don't even get along with you
(Not even a little bit) 
But the head was phenomenal, 
Used to do that in the car with you
(True)
Used to travel around the world just for the rendezvous
(Come through) 
Now I gotta get high just to deal with you these are the chronicles

Habits,rap,machine gun kelly,2017,173738,"[Verse 1]
Ay
Complicated
Frustrated
Underestimated
Can't sleep, mind racing
Hard to stay concentrated
Foreign towns, missing home
Please don't forget about me
Tell the story, all the glory
Fuck what they say about me
Some days I feel
So out of place with all these fake people in my face
I cannot relate, yeah
Sometimes I feel
Like I create, and they just take everything  I make
Turn around and then hate
Maybe I was living off expectations
Or I was born in the wrong generation?
(That's probably it)
Meanwhile I'm crushing weed overseas
Hopefully tonight we'll find more
Long days on tour
Backstage getting boring
But step on stage and they roaring
[Bridge]
I fell in love with a very bad habit
But I feel alive for the very first time

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna die
But I don't, I don't wanna hide
Or keep shit inside
I will not cry, so
I deal how I deal with it, deal with it
I am 13 hours clean and still counting
Save me from these day dreams about it
Under full moons, night swims, and tattoos
I cannot stand these fucking rules
I been sailing too long in cold water
Restrain me from these pills and more doctors
And erase me from this page and start over
I wanna start over

[Bridge]
See
I fell in love with a very bad habit
I was alive for the very first time

[Verse 3]
You said goodbye when I was trying to say
”Something ain't right inside of me”
I wanna run away
(I want to run away, run away)
I don't wanna stay
(I don't wanna stay, I don't wanna stay here)
I wish you could relate
I'd wish upon a star- fuck that, leave it up to fate
We are who we are so don't judge me
Just 'cause it's hard to smile
Read between thin white lines
See what's in my mind

Fire in the Booth,rap,machine gun kelly,2016,1603,"Now there's a meaning to this thing called life
But you just gotta find it in this thing called strife
I wish I could rewind and show you this is all hype
Show you just because they stars doesn't mean they got stripes, for real though
But me, I got them verses that'll kill though
And me, I'm EST now that's a family I would kill for
Shout out to the fans who held me down before the deal though
And I can't forget my team, I pray one day we make a million, and blow it all
Cause when we die we ain't taking it with us
Materials make a king, knowledge makes an apprentice
Now ain't that backwards we impressed by the fame in this era
Shit, my girl a queen, she don't need a tiara
We don't need an umbrella either just give us the rain
We don't need help, they the built the pyramids without a crane
Insane sometimes I feel we born without a brain
They only looking at the dollars, what I'm lookin' for is change
I'm sayin, if that shit doesn't register, might as well get used to stealing singles out the register
Baby momma calling, she need 30 for a pedicure
Student loan collector blow your phone up on the regular
This isn't even it baby, this isn't it baby
We supposed to have a condo and a crib baby
But you forgot the first rule of the game
They don't remember riches, they just remember the name
Kells...
Now go and get it homie
One thing for sure I know the block ain't gonna get it for me
Two thing's for certain, I ain't tryna let em pidgeon toe
And if they is just know I'm walking with my pistol on me
This ain't that B shit or C shit, this is that D-o-r-D shit
That means Do or Die, cause ain't no you, if it's you and I
I ain't no gangster but I will be just to stay alive
I'm rollin' indica, staying high
Roll to the cinema and stay the night
My life's like TV with this daytime drama
All this Law and Order, a lot of comedy
And relationships like Tina and Ike, these bitches crazy
That's why I'm tellin' ya
Look up to the stars instead of staring at a cellular
You could be the greatest why would you wanna be regular?
Just know that your greatness comes from how they gon' remember ya
Not from how you spend baby, that isn't it baby
Man we ain't gotta have a condo or a crib baby
But you forgot the first rule of the game
They don't remember riches, they just remember the name...

Rose from the ashes like a Phoenix
Rose feelin', rose feelin' up in the marinas
Got my weight up in my hood we call that triple-beamin'
Fuck introductions, skip the name and just call me Cleveland
Homie callin' for bail, tryna get out the precinct
Tellin' me give 'em hell, funny I started preaching
And when I say I got us bet the city gon' believe 'em
Cause everybody left us and they know I'm never leaving
So I turn it up one time for the days runnin' on the corner
Talkin' shit and getting lit from sippin' brews in Arizona
And when one time came through everybody gone except for me
I couldn't leave, I am the loner, with the mind of a stoner
And dreams of putting this game in a choker
And fuckin' until she pay me like Oprah
I'm not a hoper, I'm a knower of what's in the forecast like Al Roker
So even if it pours, I am Noah, two oars
Two rowers, row us to two shores
I found promise land, now we lying on two floors
One for the fam, the other for two whores, shit
Fuck two minutes, I did this in two chords, of course
I'm too versatile for a chorus
I've done too many tours to be a tourist
Fuck the magazine, I am the Source
I am too boss to be employed, more stories about your boy than Chuck Norris
Man, listen up
All I know, all I know
I am from the city where the grass don't grow
I am from the city in the middle of the map
Where half these motherfuckers that rap don't go
All I know, all I know
If I throw this cash then her ass gets low
But I am from the city where the cash don't flow
So I keep it for myself and I smash that ho
Smash that ho, smash that ho
Treat her like a bop it and I pass that ho
But I ain't saying nothing that my fans don't know
I'm an EST boy till the casket close
Six foot deep, six foot three
Eight motherfuckers in the SUV
Eight new states in a seven day week
Whole world laced up like some brand new sneaks
And they know I'm gonna raise till I'm face up
Fuck check-out time, we don't wake up
Damn these EST boy's done came up
Dirty ass chucks and a bad bitch lace up

OK, where the strong at?
Right there, put me on that
Hit it once and you're jumping like Mortal Combat

Tatted on my choker
Shoppin' sprees at Dover

Slap me if I’m sober
Yea, yea, yea, come over
Fucked two girls that looked like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler

Back shot, back shot, back shot, back shot, right behind the backdrop
Can’t stop, can’t stop, can’t stop, can’t stop turnin' up like mascots
Matlock, Matlock, Matlock, Matlock want me in them padlocks
I hope you got a plan, catch me if you can hoe

Yea hoe, can’t get jammed hoe, I’ll be damned hoe
Yea hoe, I’m the man hoe, from the Land hoe
Yea hoe, out them bandos, to these bands hoe
Sandals for my fam though - 3, 2, 1, takeoff
Jets round the world with them
And you know we gotta fly with the herb with them
In the town, I’m a chief like turbo and them
Shouts for the flow G Herbo and them
I just got the cell phone workin' again
I just got the styrofoam purple again
Never make threats non-verbal again
You already know how I'm lurkin' again

Alright Flex, look

[Verse]
Where were you when I was down, I got questions
Now, it's all these hoes in the lounge at the Westin
I just met somebody’s parents, left a bad impression
They smelled a package that I just picked up from the reception
Hey, fuck 'em, I'm stressin', I don’t learn my lesson
Customs locked me down in LAX for coke possession
Just had a publicist that left, said I was too aggressive
Then had a ex that couldn’t stand me 'cause I'm not possessive
Impressive, haha, I just want to say
I ditched the VMAs and went back up the way, ayy
From the ghetto to a rock god, hit 'em up like 'Pac
Let's just keep it G
Only Eazy I fuck with is E (damn)
I seen he dyed his hair and got a hanging earring
I fucked his girl, now he look like me, this shit overbearing
How dare him, I dare him
Don’t think about comparing
Man turn that frat rap off, I’m getting sick of hearing
I’m in LA, at my spot, right next door to Terrence
I’m knocking on the door next time I see Kanye’s McLaren
Like, I need beats (ayy)
Like, hook me up with Kendall
Man, all the masses out in Calabasas got me mental
Bitch, I’m a dog, yeah, I came up out the kennel
And that teardrop on my partner eye ain't cause he's sentimental
Look, I told you, I told you that I’m coming (yeah)
They should've left me doing pop, y’all don’t want me gunnin'
My daughter's with me, ain’t no school yet, it’s the end of summer
So close your ears, your daddy’s bout to kill these motherfuckers
Lyrically, I’m 6 feet I'm
23 MJ on the beat I'm
Stronger, faster by design
I’m a Lambo, you’re a Nissan
I’m the big bad wolf, no peace sign
Gonna give these fans their tea time
I would tell their man’s he’d be fine, but then I’d be lying
I’m mobbing in that all-black Range
With a long list of names, duct taped, y’all ain't safe (ugh)
Clinically, I’m insane
Industry is full of lames
Gone when the cops came (ugh)
Paper planes (ugh) sugar cane (ugh)
To the brain, bottle drained, numb the pain (ugh)
I’m just saying (ugh) I’m ashamed (ugh)
I paved this lane and they don’t even say my name
Yeah, I’m white, yeah, I’m rock and roll, yeah, I got soul
Yeah, my daughters black, yeah, I love to rap, yeah, I’m fighting back
Yeah, I hate the fame, wish I had a mask
Yeah, I got pulled over with my stylist, had no license, and a strap
Plead the fifth, that ain’t Saks (ayy)
Speak some facts (ayy)
All you dummies love money, do some math
Seven digits in my 20’s (yuh)
A misfit, fuck the critics, everyone of yah
I used to burn a Fader magazine in public (yah)
Just 'cause one journalist, a hater, and a sucker (yah)
High school reunion on my calendar, you know I’m ready
I’m leaving tour just to show up, you now I’m fucking petty
I ain’t forget none of you pussies and the rest of y’all been playing too long
Let's take it back to Vegas on my 22nd at the Palms
Got a call, my life was being threatened by a pimp
He ain’t know I’m in the room with 20 goons and J. Prince
Now, I’m pissed
Y’all done made me talk my shit

Oh my God, Ronny

[Verse 1]
Ayy, somebody grab him some clippers (Zzzzt)
His fuckin' beard is weird
Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
""I think my dad's gone crazy,"" yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be forty-six years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout ""I'ma call up Trick Trick""
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie, we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck ""Rap God,"" I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'
[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper
That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go up to Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' fifty
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff
When you the one that called Diddy? (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the G.O.A.T
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brrah)
Don't have a heart attack now (No)
Somebody help your mans up (Help)
Knees weak of old age, The Real Slim Shady can't stand up
[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it

[Verse 3]
Hello Marshall, my name's Colson
You should go back to Recovery (Wouh)
I know your ego is hurtin'
Just knowin' that all of your fans discovered me (Hi)
He like, ""Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me""
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (Pussy)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Facts)
I said on Flex anyone could get it
I ain't know it would be you
[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it

[Bridge]
Ayy, ridin' shotty 'cause I gotta roll this dope
It's a fast road when your idols become your rivals, yeah
Never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm an asshole
Bitch-ass motherfucker
Oh my God, Ronny
Fuck Kells

[Verse 4]
We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you (Thank you)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)

But ain't going back down, ya dig?
Hollerin' yeah for sure, we made it, in trends I rock the latest
Came from nothing but lint in my pocket

Inspiration's what paid us, so I give credit to all my haters
Yeah, and I can't help it that I'm hood bitch
Step out of the jet with Hardstone [?] see that I'm good, shit
I make this money rain, sleet, hail, snow

Ayy, don't be asking questions about who I'm dating
Ayy, even if I got a girl, she know I'm playing
Ayy, smoke that tree like Willow, then moonwalk like Jaden
Ayy, bossed up, got my gang rich, like this shit contagious
Ayy, twisting up my fingers, no this ain't sign language
That's that gang shit, how I’m raised back on that up the way shit
Earn my stripes, you know I spilled my blood all on the pavement
Knocked that man out, had to make a million dollar payment

Not at all, but the top floor, rented all
Hoes in hotels, and the hall
It's like Odell, how I ball
Got a whole sale with the straw
Now my nose red from the raw
Mug shot, locked up abroad
Fuck the police and the dogs, hold up
Break the rules 'cause y'all don't own my life
Man, suck my dick
Cops so racist, thirteen years old
Lost my boy, shed tears for him
Raised by wolves so when I'm nice
You know that's me in rare form
Used to ride that public transportation, now I'm airborne
I still ride or die for everybody that I care for

[Verse 1]
Why the fuck do I gotta remind everybody
When the time is finally mine
I've been killing rhymes for last ten years
Anybody interfere be clear, I'm here like-
I don't wanna have to be the one up in the office
That's slapping the bloggers like Straight Outta Compton
Baseball bats like a LA Dodger
I ain't finna play this year
Gotta upgrade this year
Get a payday and a AK for the nay says
In the race, like I feel a Tay-K this year
Got a big day this year
I ain't even the type to do it but Imma get a big chain this year
Just so everybody all the way in the back can see me whenever I get on the big stage this year
Go look at the speed on the dash and put it on the track
If you think I'm speaking too fast
I'm about to turn everything up until the speakers collapse
And make her ass ji-ji-jiggle like it's Khloé Kardash
I brought a beaker of hash
For everybody here that need to relax
And if it's beef I'm repeatin the past
Loose lips, get blood, like a bitch on a rag
I got drip like a leak in a bath, aye
[Bridge]
Forgot about you when you wasn't speakin' the facts on the podcast you got me
And you and me in the past
So, when I pass cards, then, I got to see ya the last
I'm kicking on your teeth to the come out of your ass
Not to mention that you girl is tryna to smash
So, I sent up dinner at seven told her meet me at [?]
Incredible that she blow me under the table
A lot of drink [?]

Just so everybody all the way in the back can see me whenever I get on the big stage this year

Eating penne, pink sauce like Gotti
Young king on the throne like Joffrey

Wide awake still, not even yawning
Not even sure why I'm up at dawn like I'm celebrating
When my agent told me that no one's calling
It's a ounce in my living room on the couch
Next to a couple homies that smoked it and passed out
So I'm alone with my thoughts in this glass house
In the cabinet are glass vials, I just poured all the last out
I smelled her, now she's on my mind
I met her the first time my light turned lime
Hate it when she's gone, but she ain't hard to find
Left her on my desk, she made designs in little lines

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
It's 5:3666
It's 5:3666
[Chorus: phem]
Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain
Can't sleep for days, gotta stay up, stay up forever

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ayy, look, I'm writing this at 5:3666 in the evening
In my head, talking to these demons (Demons)
In my bed, staring at these ceilings
I just bleached my hair and changed my whole appearance
I'm just fed up with these smoke and mirrors
My uncle sold some pictures of me with no clearance
What the fuck is family? I can't take that serious
Thank God everybody sucks so I can write these lyrics
Go pick her up, I need to lift my spirits
They don't know that we hook up, I don't let cameras near us
There's some shit I do, when she's around, I shouldn't share
Like that week I spent locked in a room with her in Paris (Fuck)

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
It's 5:3666 (Yeah)
It's 5:3666

[Chorus: phem & Machine Gun Kelly]
Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain (Name in my brain)

Hollywood Whore,rap,machine gun kelly,2019,224929,"[Verse 1]
Am I wrong for being lost?
The pressures of being boss exhausted every bone in my body
I can't walk
I don’t talk, I scream, I don't stop to think
I'm so close to the dream that I can’t go to sleep
Ironic, I know, so I need more chronic to roll
Tryna find what's more important, the money or my soul
It's cold, I'm low, I'm caught between the roads
Under the Hollywood sign, you get blinded by the glow, uh
Yo, how could you look me in the face?
You sat at the table with my daughter promising you got us
Right after you finished saying grace
Why don't you tell her what you're hiding in the bank?
It's time to cut my lawn to see the snakes
It’s time to tell the truth to every fan who doesn’t understand
That it's because of you they had to wait
While you left me here to deal with all the hate
I still smile, but feel so fake
It’s no sun, the clouds are opaque
So much shade I read on one page
I can't even look at your name without getting the shakes
What a mistake, uh, look how you take, uh
What doesn't belong to you, this was a rape
And if fate send us both to Heaven
I'ma keep a blade in my leather so I can kill you at the gate, uh
[Chorus]
(First place)
Is it worth it when you see it’s all (Two-faced)?
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space)
Commit third-degree murder (What for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore
(First place)
Is it worth it when you see it's all (Two-faced)?
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space)
Commit third-degree murder (What for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore

[Verse 2]
I woke up sweatin', tryna forget I'm in a mansion
'Cause fans are mad at my expansion
And my friend I thought was family
Who'd always understand me
Got offended 'cause he jealous
We supposed to be at the GRAMMYs
I'm asking, when did pride and passion
Get mistaken for handouts and ass-kissing?
The fact is I made it from trailer trash to Saks 5th
Took it from underground to massive, and the come up was classic
Back when white boys rapped, they gettin' their ass kicked
I was battlin', putting these rappers in caskets
I was walking home, getting jumped after classes
Tell me why don't my haters mention that shit?
Now my rent is due and I'm a tenant getting by with no credit
Got residue from a sedative I ain't get from the medic
My schedule is so fuckin' hectic, but still I'm in debt
I'd be better off dead so life insurance keep my family fed
It's because of y'all, I couldn't separate from my career
Because of y'all, I hated myself for so many years
Because of you, you ain't never gonna see me trust
Even if I got a wife, she just somebody I fuck
[Chorus]
(First place)
Is it worth it when you see it's all (Two-faced)?
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space)
Commit third-degree murder (What for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore
(First place)
Is it worth it when you see it's all (Two-faced)?
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space)
Commit third-degree murder (What for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore

Caffeine for the heartache
Never wanna have it my way

Yeah, I fuck up and lose control
Burned so many bridges, got nowhere to go
Bitches got these motives like Anna Nicole
I'm smoking cigarettes alone until it burn a hole
In my lungs, in my soul, in my denim coat
Same place I'ma keep that knife if I'ma slit my throat
This shit ugly, I was just with Nipsey, now he ghost
They even got my homie Pete out here, like, fuck the jokes

I've been through hell, I think I'm somewhere in between
Caught in purgatory, I can paint the scene
Everything turned to a nightmare from a dream
Look, wish Lil Peep and me had spoke, but I can't get that back
Just came from Pittsburgh, damn, I miss my homie Mac

But now he gone, and ain't no going back, uh

I always hated to smile, but it keep what is killing me hidden inside
I didn't sign up to be the hero, but I don't want to wind up a villain
I put my daughter to bed, then attempted to kill myself in the kitchen
Yeah, I should've screamed, but nobody listened
So I passed out with the blood drippin'
In this glass house, feeling like a prison
Me and death keep tongue-kissin'
I just fell out with my lil' bro, the life getting to us
The drink getting to us, the drugs getting to us
This highway to hell and everybody knew it

That be storing my shit
Just had a conversation with a girl that I dated
Now she out here whoring and shit
I got a reputation to be going and showing up
4 in the morning and shit
I had an altercation down in Florida
I threw his face on the floor of the shit

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Fuck a bitch, though, huh
Y'all ain't want us before we was rich, ho
I can't go back to this shit, I need a castle and shit, I'm on some Dracula shit
I used to have to heat up pans of water to shower
But y'all don't know half of this shit, no

Stop the debate if my name isn't mentioned
In this generation as one of the greatest
From lyrics to cadence
I changed the way rappers rock out on them stages
I saw people take it, and they were more famous
So I ain't get credit, I had to be patient
I know people hate me just by my appearance
You motherfuckers can't be serious, ayy

I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah
No invites, yeah, keep my circle tight, yeah

Death in My Pocket,rap,machine gun kelly,2019,126047,"[Chorus: Naomi Wild]
I got death in my pocket and nothing but time
All these bones in the closet, in the back of my mind
I just leave 'em there, I don’t even care, no
Holding up a flare, I could use a prayer, oh
I got death in my pocket, but I feel so alive

[Interlude: Machine Gun Kelly]
Don't know why, but it feels like my world is crashing down
I just bought a brand...
Fuck, how much darkness does it take to get this flashy?

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Don't know why, but it feels like my world is crashing down
I just bought a brand new car, I wanna crash it now
How much darkness did it take to get this flashy now?
I lose a piece of my soul when the camera flashes
So I’m just asking every fan who's questioning my passion
Thinking I'm caught up in fashion or that I forgot my past
To understand that I'm just a dropout, I don't have the answers
I became a dad so young, I ain't know how to use them Pampers
Baby mama's food stamps kept my stomach full
I had to make a plan 'cause now my family needed me to make it rapping
Me and Slim back at that address, 128th, we trapping
Writing lyrics down on napkins
Room so small, we shared a mattress
Look what happened
[Chorus: Naomi Wild & Machine Gun Kelly]
I got death in my pocket and nothing but time
All these bones in the closet, in the back of my mind
I just leave ’em there, I don’t even care, no
Holding up a flare, I could use a prayer, oh
I got death in my pocket, but I feel so alive

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Don't know how I get so high, but I’m not passing out
I guess the drugs are  in my blood, hope I don't pass it down
Hope I'm alive to see my baby get her cap and gown
'Cause doctors told my dad he won’t be here a year from now
Yeah, my first reaction was to punching the wall until it's cracking
Both my knuckles shattered, don't ask what the fuck's the matter
I've been battling the fact I lost my closest to cancer
The only thing she asked was for me and him to get closer
But I hung up too fast, went to sleep in and then she passed
You've been silent seven years, it took that to get us back
We all needed second chances, I've been bottling the sadness
I guess I'm just happy that we finally got to bury shit before the casket

[Chorus: Naomi Wild & Machine Gun Kelly]
I got death in my pocket and nothing but time
All these bones in the closet, in the back of my mind
I just leave 'em there, I don't even care, no
Holding up a flare, I could use a prayer, oh
I got death in my pocket, but I feel so alive
[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
I think I'm ready to die tonight
It's fucked up 'cause I ain't lived half my life
I saw the devil and passed him like

Floor 13,rap,machine gun kelly,2019,212098,"[Intro]
Fuck

[Refrain]
I just spent too many minutes watchin' little videos of shitty wannabe rappers dissing me
I just spent the winter livin' after someone tried to send a kill shot, missin' me
Young blonde Don and the double-X mob got a gang out in Sicily
Why you think they call me the Gunner?
I'm poppin' off on anybody if they trigger me

[Verse 1]
Black and yellow jacket on like I'm Kill Bill
Grew up scrappin' and I still will
We can take it back to 2012
I was trappin' on the tour bus with Meek Mill
Take it back to Cleveland, when they gave Chase 17 years, no plea deal
2014 when the people tried to rob me in the lobby
I bet they can feel the feet still
Point out my enemies soon as they mention me
Call an assembly, pick up a pen and put you out your misery
Written in history, it was gonna happen eventually
I just can't wait 'til the day that I run into you physically
For everything that I went through mentally
When it felt like everybody in the world was against me
When all the critics and every article tried to offend me
My daughter slapped a kid for talkin' 'bout me in elementary
We ain't playin', it's deeper than the fame
People gettin' checked for disrespectin' the family name
Two chopsticks, no lo mein
Hollow tips, got no name
Bust them shits with no aim
Like it's Bird Box
But the blindfold is a black flag this time to cover my face
The dash cam just saw me killin' everybody
[Chorus]
I got off on floor 13, no in between
I roll my weed with fronto leaf
I chop my coke on hotel keys
I chopped his face like Constantine
Constantly get déjà vu
I see me when I look at you
I never die, I multiply
So don't cry at my funeral

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
What would this generation of hip-hop be
Without me here to piss y'all off?
I see the blogs, I read the comments
I'm confused, I need to pause
Look at y'all waitin' on me to fall off
While I'm lookin' at y'all from a suite in the Waldorf
I sold 40 million records, I ain't even 30
Give me 20 seconds, I'll list 10 movies that I've been in
One legend that tried to fuck with me and then got the venom
One publication that said that I would never be in it
One agent that told me without her, my career is finished
And I couldn't give a single fuck inside my cerebellum
Y'all award shows suck, go tell 'em
We ain't suckin' no dick in the 216
Brought O's to the land like Beckham
On the 13th floor with a weapon
I heard that they coming, yeah, let 'em in
I got somethin' for 'em, yeah, please forgive my sins
Blood on my Ralph Lauren, yeah, I can't wash this shit
Wake up, say, ""Good morning,"" yeah, like I forgot
[Chorus]
Got off on floor 13, no in between
I roll my weed with fronto leaf
I chop my coke on hotel keys
I chopped his face like Constantine
Constantly get déjà vu
I see me when I look at you
I never die, I multiply
So don't cry at my funeral

Burning Memories,rap,machine gun kelly,2019,109601,"[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly & Lil Skies]
Yeah, this one's for the mama that I never knew (Never knew)
I took acid just to burn all of my memories of you
I guess now I really wanna know the truth
How'd you leave your only child at nine for another dude?
Took that pain and punched my father in the stomach 'til he bled
Hit the store and stole a 40 and took that shit to the head
All the years that you ignored me, left me sleepless in the bed
I hope that he got some kids because your only son is dead
My revenge, got it in the end (In the end)
I'm so hard to reach, you won't see me again (Me again)
I spent 20 years waiting on the stairs
Now I'm finished thinking anyone will ever hear these prayers

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
If I die before I wake, smoke me out at Heaven's gate
Bring me back to life on Sunday, pour me up the devil's drink
Wake up, go to work on Monday, grind it out for seven straight
You showed me that just because we're blood don't mean we relate

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Phem with Lil Skies]
All my dark days came in the summer
All my thoughts changed, now I'm the loner
Everything stayed, you were the runner
Watched your train go away through the tunnels
[Verse 2: Lil Skies & Machine Gun Kelly]
Hold up, stack my money up just for a rainy day
Play with MGK and I will pull up where you stay (Yeah)
I die for my brother, I don't have nothin' to say (No)
I died when my baby mama told me I was fake (Damn)
I got real shooters, they ain't worried 'bout a case (Woah)
I got people talkin', but won't say shit to my face (Yeah)
EST for life, my opps all rolling in they grave (Damn)
See me doin' good, I put that work in like a slave (Work)
Up all night, mind cloudy, don't be spooked
If I show you love, then will you always tell the truth? (Truth)
Feel like I'm goin' crazy, couldn't trust no one but you (You)
Suicidal thoughts keep tellin' me jump off the roof
If I die tonight, know, I ain't got nothin' to prove
CSI gon' say we was the realest in the room
Fuck with mine, I kill 'cause I got everything to lose
Fuck with mama, you know what I'll do (Yeah)

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
If I die before I wake, smoke me out at Heaven's gate
Bring me back to life on Sunday, pour me up the devil's drink
Wake up, go to work on Monday, grind it out for seven straight
You showed me that just because we're blood don't mean we relate

[Outro: Fingazz & Lil Skies]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The memories (Woah) keep playing on repeat (Yeah)
I burn 'em all so I can start sleeping (Woah)
And all the bad, I'll make it good (Yeah)
I wouldn't change the past if I could (Woah)

Roulette,rap,machine gun kelly,2019,78751,"[Chorus]
This that mothafuckin' rider music
This that mothafuckin' rider music
All night, when I'm rollin'
Dirty, how many times you gon' play with death before you 30?
But I'm chosen, so I'm rollin'
With 11 of my closest, on a mission to get rich like Danny Ocean, how we rollin'
All through traffic with this mob apparatus
These people want me in a casket, still I'm rollin'
I heard Heaven got a place for me there, but I don't know if I'm goin', uh

[Verse 1]
Smoking on sequoia, running from my paranoia
Hollywood want me to come and live and die in California
I ain't going out like River Phoenix
I wanna enjoy all of the spoils
I'm a Golden Boy like Oscar de la Hoya
I'm a soldier masked up like it's the end of October
Blowing doja in the streets with Mannie Fresh down in the Nola
I done told ya, when it comes to beefing, I ain't kosher
Bought a cobra just to keep you snakes closer
I can spy a motive, y'all can try and clone this
Get them lies quoted, but him and I know this
Line up my opponents, hold their eyes open
Rip out their hearts and let 'em all die soulless
[Chorus]
This that mothafuckin' rider, music
This that mothafuckin' rider, music (Eastside, ayy)
This that mothafuckin' rider, music
This that mothafuckin' rider, music
All night, when I'm rollin'
Dirty, how many times you gon' play with death before you thirty?
But I'm chosen, so I'm rollin'

All through traffic with this mob apparatus
These people want me in a casket, still I'm rollin'
I heard Heaven got a place for me there, but I don't know if I'm goin', uh

[Verse 2]
Wait, I heard 'em say they want the old Gunner
Fuck 'em, I still turn coyotes into road runners
Fuck a family, I'll leave your ass with no brothers
It ain't no love when you become a man with no mother
That's what it was
I used to get my ass beat just because (For real)
I ran away and hit the trap, they couldn't make me budge
Junior year, my homie selling crack right off the bus
Knew that I wasn't turning back when I got cuffed
Fuck a charge, this a territory, y'all don't wanna march
Cemetery full of graves, I can finish what you start
Lost a milli when they sued me for a fight inside a bar
I hope you pussies think of me every time that you see the scar
[Chorus]
This that mothafuckin' rider, music
This that mothafuckin' rider, music (Eastside, ayy)

This that mothafuckin' rider, music (Turn up)

All through traffic with this mob apparatus
These people want me in a casket, still I'm rollin'
I heard Heaven got a place for me there, but I don't know if I'm goin', uh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, 24/7, I keep my eyes open, ready
All these signs show me they want me gone like I'm Makaveli
On the cross when they cross me over, over something so petty
Kill 'em all even if I die like Method Man did in Belly
I am... Gun Kelly, ain't shit you can tell me
Get me drunk and mad enough, I go pop the trunk of the Chevy
I'm a dad and a savage, this is not an image like Getty
Rap for currency, like I'm Spitta Andretti and let it fall like confetti
Ball for my dogs that they got locked in the celly
And fuck the one that turned on me, I won't ever forget it
You learn it's your own homies you knew since the beginning
That see you winning and then wanna see you finished

I'm a demon in the night, she's an angel with the white

Help you put back on your clothes, make sure nothing's on your nose
Ain't even tell my closest homies, nobody knows

Yeah, I bet you do

Damn
I saw you walk in the room and I tried my best
Not to panic while I'm lookin' for the back door
I smelled the perfume and it's obvious
I'm gonna stay and put my key in the bag more
I can't, I can't, I can't pretend to forget
You're the reason I punched a hole in the wall back home
And then, and then, and then a couple hours later
We're in room 29 at The Chateau

I've wasted so much time
Waitin' around for your phone calls every night
My bad dreams are silk-screened
'Cause I taste blood when you bleed
It's eating me alive
We'd both be better off alone
Still think I'd get you on the phone
With one last breath in me
I'd die before I let you leave

Tell me why you do the things that make me
Hate you

Face you
Permanent calligraphy, I just
Tattooed

Killer Kells!
Hold, lemme get my 2's in
The game open they doors for me
Man, tell me, who let you in?
In a crack between the walls so small
You couldn't even fit your boots in (Damn!)
Dump heat whenever I speak
MC's 6 feet deep underneath all them tulips
He shootin', shootin', MGK, man, he
Flow sick enough I just, epidemic in the street
Suck on my dick and you will
Smoke a little weed, I get higher than a motherfucker
'Til somebody holler my name in the street out like
Meet him, greet him, get his girl leaving
Guts, I beat them, [?], I keep them
[?]
I'm in England spending Euros, [?]
So instead of white, I'm European
Rap like crack, now you're OD'ing
Come up with any drama than my family ties
Then fold you like an accordion
And according to the crack in the sidewalk
All you [?] bitches
Now my door's [?]
I'll rip you off your fucking hinges (Nah)
Quit pretending, pretentious, two bitches come get at me (Come on)
Red dots all over your face like acne

Cut all that tough talk, or you will get mourning
Knuckles to the mugshot, happy Halloween, good morning
No need to buck shots, this a warning

Cut all that tough talk, or you will get more than

Swoop through your motherfucking hood

Turn around, I made a fucking ass of you (Ah)

Called up his bitch showed my dick let her lay on it
I'm in the trap house like Gucci and Zay on it
I see a soda, I'm pouring an eight on it

I fucked that bitch at the Wal-Mart in Tussin Row
I had that pack at the Westin, no Smith'n tho
He tried to front on me in front of friends and fam
I had his bitch in the back, what he didn't know
I came a long way from bandos
Now all my bosses got flavored they Kenneth Cole
I walked up on a the craps game, what they hittin' fo
I keep the polish, I'm not talkin' steel toes
[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I hit a seven And picked up The dinner roll 
I get the bread then I fuck me a center fold
Eyeball the purp like my name is Gorilla Zoe
I’m from the place where the killers and sinners go
I just cut the grass and seen the motherfucking snakes
I took off my bandana and showed my fucking face

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Rose gold bandana, I tatted on my ay
Five thousand dollar soap every time I bathe (Ayy)
I just told her, ""Maybe I mean what I said"" (Ayy)
I don't really play and I hope you think it's shade
I had to jot down the names to remember hoes
When I come back with this K I'ma kill a hoe (Woo)
Thought I wasn't gettin' no syrup
I put my cum on her face but I'm pitiful (Yeah)

All different flavors and all different flavor type of hoes

Cut the cocaine with the creatine, ayy
Fuck your dead homies and your memories, ayy

[Verse 4: Lil Duke]
I got a gun it got auto and spray on it
I don't do lay away, I cannot pay on it
Foot on they neck and I swear I'ma stay on it
Can't wait till greatness so they got to wait on it
Niggas too sweet, I could just put my bae on it
I fuck on a granny, her hair and it got gray on it
Catch it out back, I'ma blow out her back
These niggas too slimey and playin' with a sack
I got the stick, I'm equipped
YSL ballin' like we won the ship
These niggas some hoes, I'ma go off the rip
Walk through the back, they take me to the VIP

Ass is so fat and it's soft as a lip
Gave her the D, now she lovin' a Crip

Right
Ayy, what my homie, Mike P, say?

[Chorus]
Roll the windows up when I get in the car and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station, go and buy a cigar
And we can smoke this blunt
Speedin' on the Sunset Strip in the nighttime
Yeah, tryna get fucked up (Aye, all my smokers, ayy, light something up)
Roll the windows up (Roll it up right now when I) when I smoke and drive

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm to the grave with this
I learned how to roll a joint before I shaved and shit (Shit, yeah)
In seventh grade and shit
I was smoking OG kush and lemon haze and shit
Bad as fuck, I had it tucked inside my backpack in the front
My dad had found it in a month
He kicked me out, he had enough so I got up
I'm in the kitchen, baking pizza with a crust
For a paycheck I can go and spend on hella drugs, yeah
Spaceships see me when I'm up, yeah
I been a martian with no Elon Musk, yeah
I'm in a party with the screw-ups and the sluts, yeah
I'm rolling papers bigger than elephant tusks, yeah (Yeah)
I'm in quarantine, but the weed man pulls up here
I got a hundred packs of backwoods
I can spend the next four months here
I spent 10K cash, I might cough up both lungs here
Filled up on gas and got high, but no stunts here
Mask on when I'm outside, drive fast, don't waste time
Ass on my face time, strap on my waistline
Gucci, Fendi, Prada belt, hold it up, no Kreayshawn
Give a fuck about these cops, put my hood on like Trayvon
All that I know is a W over my clan, I feel like Raekwon
Only time I get an L is when I be throwin' one up for the gang sign
I been a king with the bars but now I can play the guitar and the bassline
I heard them saying they doing it first, I'm doing this shit for the eighth time
I used to want a pool, now I'm waking up and I got one in the backyard
I break a lotta rules, so you know I be drivin' the whip like a NASCAR
Never went Hollywood, got a house in the hills, I still smack y'all
Never say no to the blunt, I smoke it 'til it's all the way down to the ash, y'all
[Verse 2]
I just lit a spliff blew it in a cop's face
I just hit a switch so they couldn't see the plates
Pull up to the crib, drove past four gates (Yeah)
Gave her half my dick, that was all that she could take, ay
Used both hands like she tryna say grace (Ay)
Said amen, then I blessed her face (Amen)
I don't order by the bag, I order by the crate
I'mma smoke until the suns blocked, I don't use drapes
I was really on Cleveland selling raps on tapes
I had a couple of people with me that I watch turn fake (Yeah)
I still keep gorillas with me, I ain't talking 'bout Bape
I'm a wizard with the potions, I ain't talking 'bout Snape, ay
I put a bag in my carryon luggage I walk through the airport I'm holding the shit
Somebody else put their coke in their ass and they walking through like they holdin' their shit
My boy just snuck through the metal detector and he got a pole like he ready to fish
Whenever I get a Grammy, I'm poppin' the top and I'm pouring a four in the whip
Holy shit, I'm so high, I just high fived this holiness, damn
Every shot I take, I make, it's like I'm Kobe's wrist (Whoo!)
This how I feel after a decade of me makin' hits
So if my name ain't on that bitch, you shouldn't make a list

[Bridge]
Roll the windows up when I get inside the car (I mean)
Roll the windows down when I open up the jar (See)
I'mma call the mayor, if they tryna press a charge
I'mma mob boss, I be pullin' strings like my guitar, yeah (Yeah)

Roll the windows up when I get in the car and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station, go and buy a cigar

Yo, what up, man?
Send me that instrumental real quick
Which one?
""What's Poppin'""
Alright, got you right now
Yessir, let's go

[Chorus]
What's poppin'?
Just fucked my ex, I rawed it
Two X of the mushroom chocolate
Two X on neck, I'm frostbit
Stay dressin', no balsamic
Got commas, Comme des Garçons'd it
Cup got ice cubes like Compton
Chef Nobu, cook me raw fish

[Verse]
Long beards but the squad's not Amish
Just bosses, dropouts and convicts
Wallet's bigger than Chris Wallace
Dead presidents inside, it's haunted
Yellow tape where I'm from, stay cautious
Made mixtapes wearin' shirts with the horses
It's been a minute since I gave a fuck about a critic's
Opinion but they keep on forgettin' where the bars went
Old-timers, damn, y'all got Alzheimer's?
Can't say what your subconscious think
Be honest y'all hate that I switch genres
Fuck models, switch condoms
Eat beef like McDonald's
Eat rappers, Jeff Dahmer
Top five of the young rhymers
Been sick, no virus
I'm an OG now, I do not pay homage
Look, I'm a Cleveland Cavalier
Drivin' foreign engineer
At the Fashion Week in Paris
Cinderella on my terrace
Glass slipper on the stairs
Ass fatter than Shakira's
I saw her live at the Super Bowl
I was in town for a movie role
Toosie Slide in the booty hole
Smokin' woods, eatin' tuna roll
Playing cards like it's Yu-Gi-Oh!
And I was only in the studio
I wake up, I'm moody, I roll up some fruity
That have more colors than a Coogi coat
I'm not a rapper that talk 'bout designer
But this is from Virgil and Louis though
Inside my closet's a million options, I put on all black like a funeral
I hop out the plane in pajamas, I do this shit daily, I don't even plan it, woah
[Chorus]
What's poppin'?
Just fucked my ex, I rawed it
Two X of the mushroom chocolate
Two X on neck, I'm frostbit
Two eggs with cheese and sausage
I’m in bed, she fed me topless

[Outro]
Three X's next to the names of the last three hoes on my missed call list
Yeah, yeah, red eyes I can't see clear
Whoa, whoa, my brick so white, it glow
Damn, damn, she made an OnlyFans
Ugh, ugh, can't write my life in books

​​​​pretty toxic revolver,rap,machine gun kelly,2020,160821,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Danger, one of us just lost our savior
Gotta maintain when you're going insane, so I say this prayer
Dear God, why do I need this medicine to control my anger?
And do you even exist? They're trying to say it's a myth
Lotta things left unsaid, lotta things left unanswered
My aunt just passed from cancer
Dad just got out of rehab
And mom's never gonna show up, gotta grow up
Ride with me through the memories inside of me
'Til the nights I was hooked on the ivory
Head hurting all week 'cause of bad coke
Then the same week Peep overdosed, that's fucked up
But I guess I lucked up
And I feel his pain because it probably won't be until
The day I die that they love us
But trust, every nomination I don't get
Every list that I ain't on
Is a reminder of why I wrote songs in the first place
As a way to escape where I came from
[Chorus]
This just my pretty toxic
Heavy conscience weighing on my soul
Six shots in my revolver
When I'm on my own

[Verse 2]
Play this song
On the first day I am gone, I do not want you to cry
Legends never die, I hope our story's told
And the year spent on that road
Before they came to our shows
We were creating our lane, I hope they pave it in gold
Take me home, somewhere I belong
Somewhere foreign, looks like Dali's drawing
Yeah, isn't it funny that whenever you got a vision
A mission and a couple of plans to go with it
Somebody gotta come along mad and damage it
Like a cancer that inhabits never banishes
I managed to smoke five grams of cannabis
And still keep my stamina for the fans and the goddamn cameras
That attack my stance like evangelists
I said truth and they couldn't handle it
So when it sinks you stand in it
I guess this is my Titanic
With no James Cameron to direct this draft of it
Just my
[Chorus]
Pretty toxic heavy conscience
Weighing on my soul
Six shots in my revolver
When I'm on my own

[Outro]
Back against the wall
It got me anxious
Helpless, frigid, cold
Late nights drinking on my own
Now I'm fearless, Al Capone

​in these walls my house,rap,machine gun kelly,2020,251539,"[Intro: Lynn Gunn]
I feel you in these walls
You're a cold air creeping in
Chill me to my bones and skin
I heard you down the hall
But it's vacant when I'm looking in
Oh, who let you in?
You walk around like you own the place
But you never say anything
I caught you walking straight through my walls
Guess it was all my fault
I think I let you in

[Verse: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look
You said I never wrote a song for you
So I hope this one is haunting you
You said even if it took forever
That me and you would be together
And I never thought that you would lie
So I'll admit I took advantage of your precious time
I'll admit I took advantage of you every night that I was on the road
Even at home, I wouldn't do you right
I'll admit it, but don't think for a minute I'ma let you
Convince me that what we started is finished
Or for a second that I wouldn't take a bullet to the head for you
Paint the bottom of my floor red for you
Kissed by an angel, touched by the devil
Blood from a nose, red as a rose petal
I think we're caught up in a power trip
She my Kate Moss, I'm her Johnny Depp
Life of a fast life in the fast lane
Fights in the cab, nights drinkin' champagne
Ice make it last, ice for the back pain
With the knife on the dash, pipe with the ashtray
And we fuck with the lights on, break a lamp shade
Did it twice in the room, once in the matinée, oh
Hide all the fresh wounds like a band-aid
With the stripes on the black suits for the campaign, oh
What a damn shame
King of the underworld, what a damn name
'Cause he killed all the other girls in the damn frame
For a queen that he never realized had fangs
Damn, do you feel what I'm sayin'?
Take a knife in the back, wanna feel my pain
Make a slice to the wrist to reveal those veins
I could see your face, man I feel insane
[Chorus: Lynn Gunn & Machine Gun Kelly & Both]
Never thought that I would feel like this (Yeah)
Such a mess when I'm in your presence
I've had enough, think you've been making me sick
Gotta get you out of my system, yeah
It's my house
I think it's time to get out
It's my soul
It isn't yours anymore
It's my house

Yeah, I think it's time to get out

And I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe?
And I run for miles just to get a taste

It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good

Lie awake 'til the sun's out
Pink sky when you come down

Ay, see, I fuck up and lose control
Burned so many bridges, got nowhere to go
Bitches got these motives like Anna Nicole
I'm smoking cigarettes alone until it burn a hole
In my lungs, in my soul, in my denim coat
Same place I'ma keep that knife if I'ma slit my throat
This shit ugly, I was just with Nipsey, now he ghost
They even got my homie Pete out here, like, fuck the jokes
Damn
Lately I've been sick of living and nobody knows how I'm really feeling
I always hated to smile, but it keep what is killing me hidden inside
I didn't sign up to be the hero, but I don't want to wind up a villain
I put my daughter to bed, then attempted to kill myself in the kitchen
Yeah, I should've screamed, but nobody listened
So I passed out with the blood drippin'
In this glass house, feeling like a prison
Me and death keep tongue-kissin'
I just fell out with my lil' bro, the life getting to us
The drink getting to us, the drugs getting to us
This highway to hell and everybody knew it
The fuck are we doing? I'm feeling like

Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame (Hmm)

Ayy, life's been hard since 17
I've been through hell, I think I'm somewhere in between
Caught in purgatory, I can paint the scene
Everything turned to a nightmare from a dream
Yeah, wish Lil Peep and me had spoke, but I can't get that back
Just came from Pittsburgh, damn, I miss my homie Mac
Yeah, last time I got off the stage, I looked Chester in his face
But now he gone, and ain't no going back, yeah

Alright

[Verse 1]
The headlines say the world is over
What ever happened to a fairy tale ending?
You can't pass if you don't know the code word
I'm inside a UFO crash landing
I'm in a room by the door
With a space invader
I know that I'm immature
But at least I'm not a goddamn failure

[Chorus]
SOS (I'm callin')
SOS, I'm calling out
SOS (I'm fallin')
SOS, I'm falling now

[Post-Chorus]
I'm upside down, I'm upside down, I'm upside down
My life is a roller coaster, roller coaster
Get me off this roller coaster
(Get me off this roller coaster)
[Verse 2]
I heard you never graduated from high school
The food sucked and the kids were awful
I know you wanted me to go to law school
I dyed my hair, pierced my nostril
I know I've done this before
But it's a mind eraser
I'm waking up on the floor
I gotta get my life back later

[Chorus]
SOS (I'm callin')
SOS, I'm calling out
SOS (I'm fallin')
SOS, I'm falling now

[Post-Chorus]
I'm upside down, I'm upside down, I'm upside down
My life is a roller coaster, roller coaster
Get me off this roller coaster

I'm in too deep, I feel too much
I'm insecure, I fuck things up
I'm in too deep, I feel too much
I'm insecure, I did— fuck

Stayed up, I couldn't sleep last night
I'll admit, I'm a little dysfunctional
Are you okay with the fact I'm a little off track?
To be honest, I've been through relationships
I've never been in love, but I want this

[Chorus]
Ever since you walked away, I can't wait to taste your breath
Sunset on my black parade, and I can't wait to see what's next
When the clothes are off, and the phones are off
And the lights are on, 'cause you turn me on

[Verse 2]
Pick up, pick up your phone
I know you just gave me your number but I wanna know
What's up with us because I got a feeling
Tell me if it's mutual
Are you with anybody right now?
Or could you step out and talk to me?
I'd text you, but it's better to call
'Cause tomorrow there'll be less that I have to delete
[Chorus]
Ever since you walked away, I can't wait to taste your breath
Sunset on my black parade, and I can't wait to see what's next
When the clothes are off, and the phones are off
And the lights are on, 'cause you turn me on

[Bridge]
Cover my mouth with yours so there's nothing to say
Even the silence that I have with you is okay
Let's do it like it's the first time, like it's the first time

[Chorus]
Ever since you walked away, I can't wait to taste your breath
Sunset on my black parade, and I can't wait to see what's next
When the clothes are off, and the phones are off
And the lights are on, 'cause you turn me on

[Post-Chorus]
I, I can't wait to taste your
I, And I can't wait to see your

Last night, I had a flight, but I missed it for you
I got a pill but I split this with you, yeah
Tongue-kissed with you, yeah
She a punk bitch, she cool, yeah
I can't tell if it was you or the drugs
But I don't think I could function without you, yeah

I think it's time to come down

Sweet like tulip but your love sour, filled with pain

Drunk face/all I know/bloody valentine,rock,machine gun kelly,2021,1433,"(drunk face)
I'm still young wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on that girl I quit
I should've lost her number

I'm overcompensating for heartbreak
Think I swallowed somethin' that's in a heart shape
Her hands on my chest feeling my heartbeat
She's spilling her drink all on my car seat
She'll get attached and then trap me
Then I gotta act like I'm happy
She posts pics to get at me
Déjà vu, just like last week
Damn

(all I know)
They tell me
All I know is I don't know nothing
All I know is I don't know nothing at all
People talk but they don't say nothing
All I know is I don't know nothing at all
No license I'm still riding
Crashed into a tree and kept driving
My labеl hates that I'm like this
I gotta go through shit to keep writing
All thesе girls, I don't want none of them
But I know I'll end up with one of them
My life on the outside is fun to them
But the person on the inside is crumbling

All I know is...

(bloody valentine)
I'm overstimulated and I'm sad
I don't expect you to understand
It's nothing less than true romance
Or am I just making a mess

In my head, in my head
I'm lying naked with you yeah
In my head, in my head
I'm ready to die holding your hand

I don't do fake love but I'll take some from you tonight
I know I've got to go but I might just miss the flight

And treat this night like it'll happen again

Pretty Toxic Revolver demo,rap,machine gun kelly,2021,607,"[Verse 1]
Danger, one of us just lost our savior
Gotta maintain when you're going insane, so I say this prayer
Dear God, why do I need this medicine to control my anger?
And do you even exist? They're trying to say it's a myth
Lotta things left unsaid, lotta things left unanswered
My aunt just passed from cancer
Dad just got out of rehab
And mom's never gonna show up, gotta grow up
Ride with me through the memories inside of me
'Til the nights I was hooked on the ivory
Head hurting all week 'cause of bad coke
Then the same week Peep overdosed, that's fucked up
But I guess I lucked up
And I feel his pain because it probably won't be until
The day I die that they love us
But trust, every nomination I don't get
Every list that I ain't on
Is a reminder of why I wrote songs in the first place
As a way to escape where I came from
[Chorus]
This just my pretty toxic
Heavy conscience weighing on my soul
Six shots in my revolver
When I'm on my own

[Verse 2]
Play this song
On the first day I am gone, I do not want you to cry
Legends never die, I hope our story's told
And the year spent on that road
Before they came to our shows
We were creating our lane, I hope they pave it in gold
Take me home, somewhere I belong
Somewhere foreign, looks like Dali's drawing
Yeah, isn't it funny that whenever you got a vision
A mission and a couple of plans to go with it
Somebody gotta come along mad and damage it
Like a cancer that inhabits never banishes
I managed to smoke five grams of cannabis
And still keep my stamina for the fans and the goddamn cameras
That attack my stance like evangelists
I said truth and they couldn't handle it
So when it sinks you stand in it
I guess this is my Titanic
With no James Cameron to direct this draft of it
Just my
[Chorus]
Pretty toxic heavy conscience
Weighing on my soul
Six shots in my revolver
When I'm on my own, back against the wall
It got me anxious
Helpless, frigid, cold
Late nights drinking on my own

I chipped my tooth and then I found a piece inside my pants
He talkin' shit, when he wake up, I go do that again
I came back
I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
If a pussy wanna say shit, then I'll fuckin' stomp his face in
Nah, not getting better, can't change it, I left blood all on the pavement
I'm on borrowed time, can't shake it, uh, blackout when I'm ragin', uh
Me and all these pills be on a fuckin' first name basis, uh
There's an invisible voice that is talkin' to me and it's always tellin' me to kill
I got a problem with separating what my head is creating from things that are real
I'm in a room, hyperventilating and debating to pop off the cap of these pills

Ay, you know where I'm at
What you waitin' for? (What?)
Pull up at my house (Pull up)
Leave you at the door
Pizzaman steppin' over bodies like this was a morgue
Preacher told my mommy I'm the devil go pray to the lord
Amen, we in the jungle and fucking with fire like cavemen
All of my jewelry under subzero, I'm feeling immortal like Raiden
This is the real definition of what a pandemic is, y'all should have stayed in
They should never let you in this world, go back in the pussy you came in
Part of mе know that my conscious could never be clеan, so I'm making it dirtier
I know that humans can live to a hundred but I've been on drugs, so I'll probably be earlier
I made an order for something that's crossing the border that had to be brought by a courier
My vision is 20/20 but whatever I'm smoking it's making it blurrier

[Chorus]
I'ma go hard in this bitch, ay
I'ma go hard in this bitch
Bitch, yeah
[Verse 2]
I'ma go hard I got scars on my face, but I feel like it's making me purtier
She on her knees when she giving me face, 'cause I told her it's making 'em scurrier

I don't watch horror movies, what I'm living in real life couldn't be scarier

I spend a lot of money on these therapy sessions
Even though I'm not showing up

But I still put these drugs in my gut
Me and my girl were just screaming at each other
Right before we both got out of the truck
I got some demons inside
I'm tryna free them inside
I'm from the Cleveland East Side
Where the boy who was just starving with you
Now might try to eat you alive, damn

Ignoring my problems (Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah)
You die, you're iconic
More plaques for their office

Um, sixteen years old, kicked out the home
Sixteen years old, out on the street
Can't reconcile, both of my parents are gone
I wanna talk to my dad but rest in peace
Last month, took a gun in the room alone
Last month, almost blew my head off
She screamеd and I never put down the phonе
I gotta be somewhere, please hang up

Now, smile for the camera
Breakups are entertaining
My mental imbalance
Mixed with the drugs create me

It's a good night, it's a good night to be high
Sober again, sober again, it's a lie
Therapy said, therapy said that I might
Do it again, do it again and die

To a lost world, to a lost world

Okay
Spaceships in the sky, we are not alone
I went out to the desert and I saw the light
Say hi 'cause the government tapped the phone
Fuck cops, read me my Miranda rights
Poison the brain, follow along
They'll make the rules for no reason
Run away, go find where you belong
And don't tell no one you're leaving

Graduated, eighteen years young
Educated by the things I've done
Wouldn't trade it 'cause we had our fun
Life goes on, life goes on

[Verse 1]
We used to all skate in the parking lot
Black nail polish on my cuticles
I got a black eye first time I fought
My girlfriend told me it was beautiful
The first time I smoked, didn't get high
Stole my dad's truck and we drove all night
Read your text and I never replied
We never got a chance to say goodbyе

[Chorus]
Graduated, eighteen years young
Educatеd by the things I've done
Wouldn't trade it 'cause we had our fun
Life goes on, life goes on
Graduated, eighteen years young
Educated by the things I've done
Wouldn't trade it 'cause we had our fun
Life goes on, life goes on
[Verse 2]
They just found my friend in the parking lot
We wore all black to his funeral
I used to be scared of the things I thought
'Cause I was high on pharmaceuticals
""Rest in Peace"" tattooed on my skin
Those memories are always within
Sometimes I can't make peace with them
I need a time machine to go back again

[Chorus]
Graduated, eighteen years young
Educated by the things I've done

I just hit a switch so they couldn't see the plates
Pull up to the crib, drove past 4 gates

And he got a pole like he ready to fish
Whenever I get a Grammy I'm poppin' a top
And I'm pourin' a four in the whip
Holy shit, I'm so high I just hi-fived his holiness
Every shot I take I make, it's like I'm Kobe's wrist
It's how I feel after a decade of me making hits

You're crazy (5150)
I won't go (5150)
You make me (5150)
I'm damaged (Please don't fix me)

[Verse 2]
I romanticized
All the wrong things for the wrong reasons
Now I'm paralyzed
Traumatized so I had to get even
[Pre-Chorus]
Bleed, bleed, bleed me out
Please, please, save yourself
Leave, leave, leave me now
Before I hurt myself

It's time to confess, confess why you said this
Time to confess, confess that you're heartless
Uh, time to confess, confess why you said this
Okay, I confess, I confess, I was jealous
Time to confess, confess that you're heartless
Okay, I confess, I confess, I'm a narcissist

The zombie apocalypse is not too far away

Ayy, someone cut the lights off please
I've been kinda sad lately
I know that I'm good for you (Yeah)
But you kinda bad, baby (Mm)
Witches doin' love chants, brewin' up the potion
I had a premonition I was overdosin' (So)
Someone cut the lights off please
I don't want you to look at me
I paint my nails black
If I ever look happy then it's an act
Every day is an anxiety attack
I wish I could take it back
To when I was drinkin' water out the tap
With the Cleveland logo printed on my hat
Tell me, was it my fear of bein' complacent
That ended up leavin' me so jaded?
I'm miserable even though I made it
Got a house in the Hills and I fuckin' hate it (Ayy)

It's gon' be chaos when it come down to my royalties
I keep it still, I miss the exit, that's by any means (Woah)
Watch out for opps, watch out for cops, they kill for anything
I got on Prada shoes and Prada tee (Yes)
I love my brother, rest in peace, I know you're proud of me
I'm pourin' mud up, tryna stay away from Billie Jean
On all these opens, everybody say I'm hardly sleep
And I got demons on my shoulder, heart gettin' colder, I'm so cold
Keep me a heater, that's my toaster
In my coat, you would never know
Streets don't love you, I don't either
I don't need ya, no-no-no
I pray on my knees and I stay strong
Take care of my family, I don' wan' die alone
