Double OT
I'm a new three

[Chorus]
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh (Swaggin')
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you (Swish, ooh, ayy)
Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay

[Verse 1]
I got me some braids and I got me some hoes
Started rockin' the sleeve, I can't ball with no Joes
You know how I do it, Concords on my toes
(This shit is hard) Oh
I ain't rich yet, but you know I ain't broke, ah
So if I see it, I like it, buy that from the store, ah (Store, ah)
I'm with some white girls and they lovin' the coca (Coca)
Like they OT
Double OT like I'm KD, smokin' OG (Smokin' OG)
And you know me, in my 2-3s and my gold teeth (And my gold teeth)
Bitch, I'm smiling, bet you see me from the nosebleeds (Nosebleeds)
I'm the new three and I change out to my new 3s (To my new 3s)
[Pre-Chorus]
White Iverson
When I started ballin', I was young
You gon' think about me when I'm gone
I need that money like the ring I never won, I won

[Chorus]
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you

That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay

[Verse 2]
Ooh, Stoney
Cigarettes and a headband
Commas, commas in my head, man
Slumped over like a dead man
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man
I'm the answer, never question
Lace up, learn a lesson
Bitch, I'm saucin' (Wow), I do this often, don't do no talkin' (No)
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans (Ooh)
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Like I'm Davis from New Orleans
Or bitch, I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it (Ayy)
I have it, I never pass it, I work my magic
High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'

Thats It,rap,post malone,2015,56297,"[Intro - Sample]

[Verse 1]
Woke up in a hot tub, spillin' Moet, in the water
Then I light my marijuana, take a shot up out the choppa
J's jumpin' out the locker, spend a little guapa
She want candy, Aaron Carter
I called her Candy when I saw her
Pull up with my brothers
Candy-painted flyin' saucer
Test me, you'll get flyin' colors

[Pre-Chorus]
Hunnid bitches comin' up the steps
Turn the front lights on, when I know they on they way
She said she don't wanna do too much drugs
Believe me, baby, I do this shit like every day, like every day

[Chorus]
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it, ayy
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it
(Stoney, Stoney, uh, yeah)
[Verse 2]
Wanna talk about them Martins?
Do you wanna talk about them Jordans?
Enjoy a 40 every mornin', Everclear and some recordin'
101, on the 101 like Jeff Gordon
I just popped a pill, she just popped a pill
And we might just pop some more, I ain't stoppin' 'til like 20
Up until like 4, SmartWater like some dummies
Takin' shots up out the semi, that shit kill me like I'm Kenny

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, bitches walkin' down the steps
Turn the front lights off, got a blunt all to myself
No, I don't want all this shit to get too deep
But listen, baby, there ain't no shit with you and me
No ""you and me,"" no

[Chorus]
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it, ayy
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it
And that's it

And I pull up on that road, doin' hundred miles and hold
Man, I poke another hole, I smoke another O
And I pour another O and I smoke another, smoke another

Hop out into the 'preme store, top notch
Already bread jumpin' out the pockets

I started throwin' a tantrum, so I copped me a Phantom
And every time she gets mad, I throw the keys to the Jag
Broke niggas call me materialistic (materialistic)
We do not ball the same, you're still learnin' how to pivot (still learnin' to pivot)
Ayy, since I got rich, I don't drink beer (nah)
Leave the mall, leave a trail of tears

If he ever feels down, we can take off in the Lear
We could be gone tomorrow, love today (love today)

Go Flex,rap,post malone,2016,1303503,"[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands, I just wanna go

Mad at me, I think I know why

In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie, you's a window shopper
At the dealership, tryna get a test drive
Homie, you's a window shopper
You mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats, my bezel heavy
Doors suicide, they say a word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg, I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you, ""Youngin', you can't handle it""
And I'm just here to tell 'em that their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game Post, people callin' me the G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated, shit my Rollie still cold
Ayy-ayy-ayy

Homie, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie, you's a window shopper
At the dealership, tryna get a test drive
Homie, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse]
Wanna talk shit on, shit on the net
But they ain't understand they see the work I, work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with, come with the 'fits
20 years old, 20 carats, carats my heavy
Door's suicide, they say a word in, word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg, I, dawg I ain't it
They wanna tear me down and tell you, ""Youngin', youngin' can't it""
And I'm just here to tell 'em that their shit never, never happenin'
Ayy-ayy, ride in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game Post, people callin', callin' G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated, shit my Rollie's, Rollie's cold

Magic Johnson 3, I ain't playin' basketball
And we got some molly, magic potion, alcohol
I'm with Aphrodite, drinkin' nectar of the gods
Wakin' up to some Swishers and some liquor (Swishers and liquor)
Fuck 'em or fuck her, whatever get me faded quicker
She grind on my zipper 'cause I'm a big tipper
She stay in L.A. like she play for the Clippers
You see what we whippin', whole crew is shittin' on mothafuckas
Can't stand the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
I got that Houdini, disappear her bikini
She rub on my lamp, damn I feel like a genie
On my magic carpet, I'm poppin' a wheelie
So fresh, you can't see me, I do this routinely
I don't do no freebies, you feel me?
I need me a couple bands
They appear in my fuckin' hands

40 got me funky (Funky)
I popped a molly (Molly), went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries (Ain't got no)
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze (Kami)

I'ma pull up in this bitch, exotic (Skrrt)
Lean in Sprite and gin in tonic
These bitches erotic
She just wanna get inside my motherfucking pocket (Yeah)
Another 40, I should stop it (Woah)
Two thousand ounces of this shit will make you feel like vomit
But I don't mind it, I kinda like it
Young and wild
We killing shit, we live this shit
I ain't go to school
They ask me how I live like this
I did my shit, 20 this year
And I'm only getting older 'til I'm in the dirt (I'm in the dirt)
How I hold a grudge with two 40's all in my hand (All in my hand)
But pull up on me, try me, you can catch the fade, my man
You and your friends

So I can be cool, yeah
Pass me the molly, ayy
I wanna them too
No, I can't get enough
Man, I'm popping them shits and I'm dropping them hits
The music, the liquor that’s why I exist
And the money, but let's skip the obvious shit
Ain't living too long if I'm living like this
Early morning waking up with the sweats
Going through shit I ain't never forget
But nothing I do, will I ever regret
I need me that cheque, I need me that chronic
I don't remember, tell me what's my name?
Drinking, swerving in the other lane
Fucking zooted drinking acid rains
Spill it on Supreme

Wavy, I'm wavy, I'm wavy on you
Started from the block, yeah I was broke, I
They ain't give me no choice but slang that coca
Dealt with the hand I was dealt like poker
Came back with the 45, like Michael Jordan, like Jordan
Started rappin', they was laughin'
Bought a spaceship, bought a mansion, with J-Lo in the Hamptons
Diamonds dancin', I bought me a crib with a lake
Purple drank like grape, bitch jump off like Blake
Diamonds lookin' like steak
Been gettin' real money, since I was so young
Montana!

Cigarettes and a headband
Commas, commas in my head, man
Slumped over like a dead man
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man

Lace up, learn a lesson
Bitch I'm saucin', I do this often, don't do no talkin'
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans

Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it

Nicotine in the bud and the L.A. lights
Fuck all that shit about your human rights

I don't wanna see your face in my line of sight
Oh boy, try stuntin' on me? It don't happen
Couple Benji's stashed in that mattress
Told her back it up, she ass-backwards
Told her I'ma bring her back to my address
Told her she can have a sip of my Activ'
She gon' smoke on weed and then she gon' ash it
Told her girl, don't be gettin' distracted
Boy, I pull up-up with your whore
That voodoo good so I roll it
Thirteen blunts, boy I smoke it
Thirteen life, boy I know it
Throw four in it when I'm feelin' Whitney
All this drinking is killing my kidneys
All this sip I'm sippin' gon' kill me
And motherfuckers walkin' if they ain't ridin' with me
Teeth shine in my mouth
Bad bitches all on my couch
You know it's foreign when I back out
Hit 'em with the woo-wap, she black out

Hoes fall asleep and all they ass out

Why Dont You Love Me,pop,post malone,2014,53588,"[Intro: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me tell you a little story
Hey girl, love me

[Verse 1: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, ""What was that?""
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie?
What the heck?

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
[Interlude: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff

[Verse 2: Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff &  Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Don't you know my friend would do anything?
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He really, really, really misses you bad (Yes he does)
He remembers all the times that y'all had
He's crying (I'm crying)
That's not okay

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
[Bridge: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?

They call me billi' for short

Tryna call me 'bout my government

Every twenty minutes, change clothes (Change up)
I had a mil' before the label (That money)
Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (Free, God bless you)
You in a better place, dawg (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Got a bandana 'round my neck, like Bankroll Fresh (Free)
Pocket full of street money (Street), 'bout to count my blessin' (Street)
One hundred, one thousand, one hundred K, one million (Uh)
We smoke, we laugh, we rap, we talked about a vision (Switch it up, haha)
I got diamonds like a rainbow every time I change clothes
Shawty fucked my friend, but I act like I ain't know
I'ma buy a raincoat, the storm might approach you
Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus
I do it on purpose, do it for the neighborhood
Smokin' on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it
Got that leather and that wood, I got the marble on the floor
Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando

I'm getting fucked up, I'm losing control
I'm bumping Fleetwood, she tryna turn off my song
She keep asking where the party at
I got a flask full of vodka in my passenger seat
My homie got a mansion says that we could crash it for free
We gotta take the phones because we can't let nobody see
We pop a pill since you ain't have not a thing to eat, oh, oh, ooh

Thunder only happens when it's raining
And players only love you when they're playing, ayy

When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

You will know
You will know
You will know
You will know, oh, oh

I came up from Texas and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'

Smoke a boge in the sky, pass the fuego

Broken Whiskey Glass,rap,post malone,2016,280703,"[Verse 1]
I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 is like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next, man, only time will tell

I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits, so I'm fuckin' your bitch (Ooh)
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker, talk saucy
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker, let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothes
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly, but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grilly

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, ""Shit, this is it,"" ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
And I can't ever tell you no

Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot

Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (Yuh)
Kicked her out the Rolls said, ""Thanks a lot""

Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (Hot)
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (Stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (Locked)
I'm so ahead of you muhfuckas'
How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (Goddamn)

Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, ""congratulations"" (congratulations)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (uh)
Yeah, we made it (uh, yah)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
I was patient (yah, uh)

But right now, I got a situation (ayy)
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins (cashes)
Big rings—ooh—, champagne (champagne)
My life is like a ball game (ball game)
But instead, I'm in the trap though (trap though)
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl (Super Bowl)

Hit the dash, spend a grand at Benihana's (got me faded, oh my God)
Everything designer
Margiela got me lookin' like I'm walkin' on some water (oh shit)
Drop the top on the whip for the summer
Just finished this bottle, think I'm 'bout to pop another
Tell the waitress, ""Keep 'em comin'"" (damn right)
We always turnt up, ho, it's nothing
And tell my old bitch ""don't worry who I'm fuckin'"" (uh)
Keep the 'rari engine running, hit the gas and I fuckin' blast past
Spillin' champagne out the damn glass

Young-Young Stoney, swangin', sippin' Remy
I just had some Henney, not the semi
Cocaine from the raft to the levies
Skate highs, bitch, Versace or the Givenchy
Only choice if we're swangin' in the Chevy (skrrt)
Young Stoney, fuck the bitch, she in the Bentley
Bandana on me, bumpin' Makaveli
Stonin', I just pour four up in the twenty (what?)
These bitches barkin' at the kennel
Had to swap bitches like a rental (yeah)
Kiss a elevator, bitch's levels
Snap a cannon with a Canon, no rebel
Gold-diggers couldn't dig it with a shovel (hell no)
In the Continental feelin' presidential (hell no)
Blowin' gas when I'm pushin' on the pedal
Bitch, Oriental headbanging like it's metal, she gon' get sentimental
[Chorus]
Pull up in the hoodie 'cause y'all motherfuckers need dealers (skrrt)
I only fuck with squad, y'all motherfuckers gettin' no features (hell no)
And I just bust a semi and I'm all out of money on my Visa (out of money on my Visa)
But no limit on the black card (hahaha)
I got it, you see me on the [?]
I just came up, I ain't never coming down
Every time we pullin' up, we gon' shut this shit down
And I ride different, I stay sippin', my roof missing, that loud twistin'
I ride different, bitch, I ride different

[Verse 2]
I got some money comin', throw it in the counters
Me and the homie blowin' money like it's nothing (pap, pap)
Couple aces in my hand, I ain't bluffin'
Top shelf, and the blunt steady puffin' (steady puffin')
Said oh, damn (damn)
So that's how it's gonna be, huh? (huh?)
When I had nothin', ain't nobody give a shit
Now I got it, wanna fuck with me, huh? (huh?)
Man, fuck off with that bullshit
Dab riggin' that toolkit (woo)
Hoes used to curve like there was new shit
Now the same hoes in a full-split
Four overloads, I'm cool, shit (damn)
Got gold all in my jewel, shit (yeah)
Got bad hoes in my pool, shit
Trips to Am-Dam, that's zoo-shit (woo)

Hahahahaha
Tank God

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Oh shit, hey (Pizzle)
I just did like twenty shots and now I'm standin' on top of a cop car (Hey, hey, ayy)
She been givin' me head for twenty minutes, man, this bitch gotta have lockjaw (Yeah, yeah, hey, ayy, woo, woo)
Ain't no retirin', bitch I'm firin' out the car, let the Glock off (Hey, hoo)
And it's a job, take the car to the karate shop and chop that bitch like water (Hey, ayy, hey, ayy)
Man, my shit been going back-to-back, grrra-ta-ta-ta, just like a choppa (Ayy, oh, hey, ayy)
Police pull up behind me, ain't no time to go and hide it, throw the rock far (Yeah, hey, yeah)
Valuable (Yeah, oh, oh, oh yeah), for twenty minutes, oh man, my shit is 'bout as swole as a gold bond (Hey, oh, hey, hey, ayy)
I got plenty more, prolly fifty more, but this is what we did so far-ar-ar

This that Amethyst Rockstar-life, might not make it
Drop gems 'til I shine bright, just be patient
Two girls in my hotel bathroom naked
That's the type of thrill that I like, don't waste it
My cup filled with no chaser, I'm wasted
Mixin' weed with the Henny, got me cross-faded
Like, ""Sorry, no interviews, y'all caught in the Matrix""
Checkin' for statements, life is what you make it
I'm never on vacation 'cause there's no days off
All the hard work, dedication, know it all pays off
I been gettin' no sleep, I been workin' graveyard shifts
I'm a Braveheart, shit, they call me the Sergeant
The general, my squadron, the Pro Era army
Droppin' bombs, this is just the calm before the storm, see
They can never harm me, my brother catch a homi

Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life
[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? (Spoil my night)
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me
Then I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis (Ooh)
Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me)
I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (Wow)
And she see those diamonds in my teeth (In my teeth)
I see her smilin' back at me (Back at me)
I think she rock with me like Jumanji (Jumanji)
It's about time, Postmate Plan B
Now she whippin' out her phone and I know (And I know)
Damn, how many videos you gon' post?
Everybody on the 'Gram gonna know
My girl at home now my line about to blow (Yeah)
I know what I'm doin' ain't right
But ain't no need to spoil my night, no need, no need

Spoil my night, spoil my night

Never know when someone come and try to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got ""Malone"" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah

Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it

They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth

It was a breeze for you (Breeze for you)
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (They can't replace you)

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)
[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)

Ahahah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah

And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah

Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore

Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended

Better Now,rap,post malone,2018,1689995,"[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around

Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

Coulda been a seamstress, still wouldn't cut him slack
Pretty much, ain't got a clue
Itty bitty piggyback off everything I do
But I'm still droppin' jaws
Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards (Oh-oh-oh)
Back to you, I'm so into you
For real, breh like I'm kin to you
If you a 10, I add 10 to you
They be mad when I tend to you
That's what the bae like
Call me Buffy 'cause that's what I slay like
These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight
These niggas wanna know what it tastes like (Oh-oh-oh)
What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo

And I'm rockin' Balmains and I got Margiela
And I step in on the saw, bitch, I got out better

And your bitch is so fly, ain't got no propeller
I been leakin' water, and it's no propeller
Never planned to ball, but I got my bread up
When I'm ballin', so wet, you need a umbrella, ayy
I'm too young to be in the club, ho
I ain't tryna step on no, no toes
Diamonds flashin' like they takin' photos
Every single jaw drop when I walk through

We be countin' money while we get lit
I'm just countin' up 'til I'm rich, yeah

And I'm watchin' money fall from the ceilin'
Everything that I say, I don't mean it, hey

We gon' go for bottle, come on, come on

Goodbyes,rap,post malone,2019,1146728,"[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)

You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now

We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Lie, lie, lie)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (You lied, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights (Yeah)
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need, ayy (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
From your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran)

[Chorus: Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (That you would die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (You'd been lying)
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me (You was high)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (A different side)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Said you'd die, you said you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Know you're lying)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold fifteen million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me

'Cause they ain’t ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on ’em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Yeah, they bet I'ma fall
And I’m only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, can’t remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin’ a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain’t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah
[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever (Too clever)

Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, where you been? (Where you been?)
When it was time to do some work and put it in (Put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (Ha)
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I

Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)

Oh, girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it

Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web

Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, ""Where have you been?""

Crankin' it bit, then hangin' it bit, duh-buh-buh you hangin' in it?
Came in this bit' but it's say-bih-dih-bih

Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Damn)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go? (Ooh)
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (Stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me (Over me)
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Ooh)

Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
(Yeah, yeah) But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown

Started from the bottom, damn right, we came a long way
Talk down on my name, yeah, they try to take it all away
Never had it easy, no, they always made it hard for me
Never gave me shit, had to get my own grip
I ain't perfect, I admit
I kept going, never quit
I provided for my fam, I made sure my dog's ate
Told my shawty 'Bae, I love you, I fuck with you the long way'

Where were you when I was down bad, wouldn't give me nothing
People only seem to come around when they need something
You left me in the storm by myself, I was all alone
Diamond cross necklace, hope it only ain't good to my soul
Homies got the judge and got me feeling like Tupac
I heard that's what you gotta go do when you're this sad

And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do more than we do
I don't care, I wanna go right there
Tonight I swear, your mine, your mine and I'm

[Verse: 1]
And I'm faded
So drunk I might need a facelift
And I got bottles in my bag that I'm facing
Girl I've gotta hit you up, I'm not waiting
And I really try to feel fine but I don't though
I got a place in my mind where I don't go
I really try to feel fine but I don't though
I've gotta battle emotions, I know it doesn't show

[Bridge]
And when time hits 3AM
I'm like shit, I'm sad again
Shit I'm sad again
Shit I'm sad again
[Chorus]
And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do more than we do
And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do more than we do
And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do morе than we do
I don't care, I wanna go right therе
Tonight I swear, your mine, your mine and I'm

Yo, gotta hit him on the jack
When you comin' back? Where is you at on the map?
Everything is intact
Coulda been a seamstress, still wouldn't cut him slack
Pretty much, ain't got a clue
Itty bitty piggyback off everything I do
But I'm still droppin' jaws
Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards (Oh-oh-oh)
Back to you, I'm so into you
For real, breh like I'm kin to you
If you a 10, I add 10 to you
They be mad when I tend to you
That's what the bae like
Call me Buffy 'cause that's what I slay like
These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight
These niggas wanna know what it tastes like (Oh-oh-oh)
What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo
