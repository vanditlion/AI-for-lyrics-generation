Im Goin In,rap,drake,2009,234098,"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said ""I'm goin' in"" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' wit it
She said ""I seen it all"", I say ""No you fuckin' didn't""
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said ""I can't feel my legs"", I'm like ""Bitch, me neither""
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard",en,"yeah uh-huh um , uh-huh okay  hello mothafucka , hey , hi , how ya durrn' ? it's weezy f baby , come to take a shit and urine on these toilet bowl bitches , pussy ass niggas stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma bad to the bristle , hat to the rizzle i'm so official , all i need is a whistle bitch named crystal , let her suck my pistol she open up her mouth and then i blow her brains out you ain't met a nigga like me , you probably never will riders rollin' with me , like 11 wheels find out where you livin' , kill you in the kitchen the feds tryin' to clip us , but we ain't even trippin'  i'm goin' in , i'm goin' in i'm goin' in , i'm goin' in and i'ma go hard , and i'ma go hard and i'ma go hard , and i'ma go hard bitch i'm goin' in , i'm goin' in i'm goin' in , i'm goin' in and i'ma go hard , and i'ma go hard and i'ma go hard , and i'ma go hard  first off , you know what it is if you heard drake making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake never see me out 'cause i live in my workplace i'll give you the business , so button up your shirt straight look at where i landed , you would think i planned it i'm just doing me and you could never understand it chicks get hammered , big-dicked bandit money flowin' like a slit wrist , no bandage blowin' purple clouds , nigga i'm so sky high i ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie out of this world though , i'm so sci-fi and i don't sit still , i keep it moving like a drive-by i just tell the truth and so i'm cool in every hood spot 21 years and i ain't ever met a good cop me and wayne lean like kareem doin' hook shots cover me , i'm goin' in , and buckin' when the hook drop  i'm goin' in , i'm goin' in i'm goin' in , i'm goin' in and i'ma go hard , and i'ma go hard and i'ma go hard , and i'ma go hard bitch i'm goin' in , i'm goin' in i'm goin' in , i'm goin' in and i'ma go hard , and i'ma go hard and i'ma go hard , and i'ma go hard  it goes , hold up , wait one motherfuckin' minute it's the el capitan , i got motherfuckin' lieutenants and if i said ""i'm goin' in"" then i motherfuckin' meant it and if i brought it in the club then i'ma motherfuckin' spend it cost a few hundred bands and i'm motherfuckin' in it no need for a room , yeah you know i'm fuckin' in it she actin' like she not , but she know she fuckin' wit it she said ""i seen it all"" , i say ""no you fuckin' didn't"" you ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater ?

The Calm,rap,drake,2009,235194,"[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause
[Break]
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah
[Outro]
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
Uh, one thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over

I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still…

[Verse 1]
Clean in this bitch I'm feelin' myself goddamn a nigga rich
And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split
I'm flyer then an invitation
Like I'm the information
Toronto's been waiting and I'm glad ya'll been waiting patient
But I'm here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
(Whip it) Yeah crack that's just how I double back
Europeako jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you gon' drop
Why the fuck you keep harassing me when's that gon' stop
I guess its when my albums selling in the stores
And they sayin' damn I use to know the boy
Now I barely see em
And the little kids wanna be him
He a star now look up you'll probably see him

The money (Money), cars (Cars)
The clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
Yeah

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 1: Drake]
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude]
Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...
[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
Yeah, I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be (Yeah), I just wanna be successful (That's all I want, man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude: Drake]
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog?
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, ""God""

Miss Me,rap,drake,2010,931648,"[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said, ""Tell me what's really goin' on""
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on
[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said ""If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em""
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!
[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone

Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever, I haven’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I’m single, thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long 'cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just
[Chorus: Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
('Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say ""for life,” y'all say ""forever""
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest you gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the game
[Chorus: Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
('Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Outro: Jeezy & Aaliyah]
Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
It's a beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got 'em lil' bruh, unforgettable
You’ll never forget this, ya understand me?

Light Up,rap,drake,2010,721551,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: ""Nobody's workin' as hard as you""
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me
[Chorus: Drake & Jay-Z]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...)
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights'll make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do

9AM in Dallas,rap,drake,2010,391740,"[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, ""I guess it does"" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah
[Outro]
Uh, yeah, this what yall want

The Resistance,rap,drake,2010,441748,"[Intro]
Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty, here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
""It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!""
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough
[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

[Verse 2]
Uh, am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry 'bout getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit ""re-dial"", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

[Verse 3]
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over",en,"yesterday when we were getting high you were invited , you woulda liked it i-i- i know you all too well i said that we could kiss the past goodbye but you weren't excited there's no way to fight it you can stay but shawty , here i go  uh , should i spend a weekend in vegas ? i'm living inside a moment , not taking pictures to save it i mean , how could i forget ? my memory's never faded i can't relate to these haters , my enemies never made it i am still here with who i started with the game needed life , i put my heart in it i blew myself up , i'm on some martyr shit carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship uh , i'm 23 with a money tree growing more too , i just planted a hundred seeds it's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous ""it's happening , penny lane , just like you said !

Up All Night,rap,drake,2010,541461,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches (yeah)
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
'Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it

I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)

Thank Me Now,rap,drake,2010,372215,"[Chorus]
You could thank me now, uh, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Yeah
Well, alright
Here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of ""influential,"" I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'd have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, y-you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
'Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, 'cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around
[Chorus]
Y-You could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now (You, you, you)

[Verse 2]
Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me, I'll miss it
'Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at ""Hello""
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it–
I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position
[Chorus]
Y-you could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head (Go 'head)
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said (What I said)

Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all

And the money's so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

And it go, ""Hey now, now, watch her go down""
Oh, oh, oh

She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
''Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy

Fireworks,rap,drake,2010,514856,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream

[Verse 3: Drake]
Everythin' the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better report
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins

But won't miss them again

Show Me a Good Time,rap,drake,2010,275573,"[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

Yeah, uhh
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry 'bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground, though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go, go, go, go 'head
Go, go, go, go, go, go 'head

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a lil' class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did ('Sup, girl)
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, figure they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like “Voilà!” You do it right he just might buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Interlude: Drake & Swizz Beatz]
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands (Yeah)
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with they friends
(Come on) Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done, hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with they friends
(Come on) Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done, hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with they friends
(Come on) Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done, hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with they friends (Yeah)
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done, hair done—nails done, hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Go, go, go, go, go (As we proceed)
[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well, we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it, I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

Best I Ever Had,rap,drake,2009,1515733,"[Intro]
You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
[Verse 1]
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had

Beautiful Music,rap,drake,2009,20036,"You can't love, but I bet ya
Yo can't hine yeah

[Verse 1]
Here we Gooo
The 1st time around
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that you heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' quotas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the throne instead of being ya own
But look
[Hook:]
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin' on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go

[Verse 2:]
It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh
[Verse 3:]
Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up

Ransom,rap,drake,2008,289575,"[Intro - Drake]
Yeah
It's Drizzy, baby
You already know what it is
It's the first time—I'm high, it's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry, Mama, I had to do it to 'em
40 I see you
O, I see you, homie
I stayed late tonight, right?
You know what happen when I stay late, haha
Yeah
Boi-1da!
I swear, it's like this every single time
Toronto, I got you
I got us
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Drake]
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well, I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing 'cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it ""playing checkers""
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money, I'll be happy to connect you
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on, where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers all liars and they women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last-Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me, ""Just write every single thing you need down""
And he got it for me, and I'm as happy can be now
'Bout to start balling like I'm coming off a rebound
Yeah, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack—bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get their swagger right
'Cause I done came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you, pussy-ass hater, you should do you
You ain't heard of me, then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops! I mean a red clue; Wayne's here, suu whoop
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF, but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake, I hate to see 'em so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And know the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me, but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth? Then pull the zipper down and see
(No homo, though)
[Break: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Um...
I'm going in

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Drizzy, I got us, this is my promise
I'ma bring that barrel to them bitches' eyeliners
And what I make up would fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck-buck, then buck-buck again
I would buttfuck your friend, then suck up her twin
I put the buck up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now, don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo, I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude, always had a black tool
Even when I was at school, 'cause bullies aren't bulletproof
Red scarf, hoodie too, probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker, the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you; no, I do everything better
I get paid for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone, like a dog, motherfucker
I am going for your neck in a sec
Intercept, bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yup, I am headed to the buck
Like, buck-buck again! Might fly to L.A. and just fuck Karrine
Nahh, fuck Karrine! Let's get bucks again
And fucking spend them bucks, and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you, I'ma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted, 'bout to pop it, let's get it
Let's get it, motherfucker, what you waiting on?
It is 'bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the ""it"" you want me with
And I probably just spit on the chick you want be with
And I hate a bony bitch, only like 'em only thick
And I own hip-hop; if you don't spit, I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like ""Drake Drizzy Rogers""
Or ""Drizzy Drake Rogers,"" I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game, I'm too willing to play harder
So harder, I go, there he go
They chant ""MVP"" when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jaz, what it do?
The haters on their face and in their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told you, I get paid by the letter, like:
""A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y""
ZZ Top, yes, he rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a footnote; how long can he could go?
Wondering when he stop? Bitch, when the beat stop
So I'ma keep rocking 'til the sheet rock bend
Then, the heat I send burn skin

Paris Morton Music,rap,drake,2010,473576,"[Chorus]
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know, oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

[Verse]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women ""bitches,"" but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back, I

Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life

Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations
[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh
[Verse 3]
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say ""Get it off your chest""
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention",en,"uh , black hearts on my cardigan at the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in tell g to put his feet up on the ottoman we just up against a bunch of rappers i go harder than damn ! i'm so catriona smarter than a lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in yeah , and i'm the type to tell ya daughter things i float high , don't try and cut my water wings i'm still myself suicide bars , i kill myself charge it to the game , i bill myself and i don't feel y'all , but i feel myself aunty doe , tell 'em i deserve a mazel tov i'm rappin' like a shepherd with the muzzle off i'm next to blow , pause and i can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers} yeah , i tried to tell 'em , future let 'em know send the haters all my love , x and o i got a black box where suggestions go but i don't really give a fuck , it's prolly best you know my reality is brighter than your dreams are i got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car yeah , and the visual is stunnin' i hope they document what i'm becomin' congratulations  so what you want an award or somethin' ?

Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all

Going harder than I did

Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone
I-I-I-I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
It's just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby, forget about it
I'm headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman, weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby, after you
I’ve had a glass or two so

Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just always say the cost of living
I learn from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen
'Cause everything's easier to get into than get out of
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, I still run the committee

Fear,rap,drake,2009,342922,"[Intro]
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this ""venting""

[Verse 1]
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine
[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 2]
(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
[Verse 3]
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything
[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new

Say Whats Real,rap,drake,2008,375108,"[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, ""Damn, Drake fly""
And he just be like, ""Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em""
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, ""'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill""
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real

You Know You Know,rap,drake,2016,112704,"[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 1]
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is
[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?

The Winner,rap,drake,2009,66351,"[Verse 1]
I’m performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'ma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
[Verse 2]
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
[Verse 3]
Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in your starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin' fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us

[Bridge]
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel, I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there
[Verse 4]
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isn’t at my session
Mr.Anticipation keeping everybody guessing like

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won

Ignant Shit,rap,drake,2009,215069,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!""
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?
Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

Fall For Your Type,rap,drake,2010,43662,"[Verse 1]
Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do (yeah)
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type (yeah oh uh oh)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all (*4X*)
I believe in people like you

[Verse 2]
Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin' shit
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
Girl I’m wit' it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it’s the first impression
And I heard there’s nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it’s been a while and I swear that this one's different
That’s why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I’m just trying to correct it, and I fall

[Verse]
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, ""Is that a rose?""
""You mean Rosé? Why yes it is""
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown

Something,rap,drake,2009,78220,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Falling too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to expect you
There you go, is this a dream?
Looking like every picture that I've seen of you before
I've seen it all before

Now that it's over
I should of known better
Then you think this is real and
You could be mine
I should have known better
Slowed it down cause I feel
You needed time

Karaoke,rap,drake,2010,330366,"[Produced by Francis and the Lights]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help
[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

[Outro]

Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer, baby, come closer
I'm ready for ya

[Verse 1: Drake]
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soakin' in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you sayin' no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
'Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm wit it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too
Hope it's somethin that you thought about

Still Fly Freestyle,rap,drake,2008,144587,"[Chorus]
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

[Verse]
Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin', ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus
The names I mention are crucial; you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes
I could sacrifice a line like (mumbles)
Yeah, haha, I swear I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin', no luggage

I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing

Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January

Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be

Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long

Don't wanna come on strong

But you know I do what I gotta do

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go
[Verse 2]
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be

Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you""
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
[Verse 3: Bun B]
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?
Young Mula, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

Talking to myself but I never listen
'Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go

Shut It Down,rap,drake,2010,449935,"[Part I]

[Intro: Drake]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

Hey baby, every time you come around
Shutting it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in them Louboutins
What you want, what you need (Yeah)
I can be (Yeah) your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream, Drake & The-Dream]
And together, we shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice (They'd know)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
Every time we come around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
(And they're on it) And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice
They'd know you shut it down
[Bridge: The-Dream]
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake & The-Dream]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets (Yes indeed)
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she look like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until ya find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she ain't got my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl, who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

[Chorus: The-Dream & Drake]
You shut that thing down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
You shut it, oh, oh
And they'd notice, they'd notice
[Bridge: The-Dream]
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down, down...

[Part II]

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way, oh
What can I do, to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl, I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not tryna say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it, girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m tryna lay you down, down, down

Going in for Life,rap,drake,2007,60663,"[Verse]
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, ""Baby, those are cute, I adore those""
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit 'em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, ""my sweet surrender""
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or there's no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So don't try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
""Because I wanna win games, Coach, I'm through assisting""
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
And I'ma keep killing 'em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumping
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinking what I could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talking 'bout the D I'm throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that!",en,"i don't think they really ready for my wardrobe i show up right before the store close and blow the fee from my last four shows i do one song and use four flows she used to be a christian before now , all she wanna do is shop for christian dior clothes like , ""baby , those are cute , i adore those"" me and the salesman build a rapport so he understand the fact that i'm spending offshore dough cash-only transactions , homie and please , no receipts—the feds like to explore those they can't audit if they dont know i bought it been doing it for years , homie ; thoroughly , i thought it . . . through , what it do ? i am currently recording on a track admitting most of my currency’s imported but too late now , it's too legitimate to hit 'em with . . . a lawsuit , even if those are acts that i did commit repeat offender , anita baker playing in the whip as they pull me over , ""my sweet surrender"" i got a jewish lawyer as my lead defender a menschkeit , as they say ; he’s a legal bender and atf is present , every regal member the coalition is so efficient you have to be invited , or there's no admission we know tradition , we spend money so don't try to compete if you in no position i wish you would listen i take you back to this trial where i am about to be home again like new edition my foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in used to record in the basement that renny grew his piff in when pops turned over keys like a new ignition if hov is jordan , i guess i'm cool with pippen 'til i mention that i wanna play a new position no team-playing , no screen-setting ""because i wanna win games , coach , i'm through assisting"" the takeover , the break's over , nigga and i'ma keep killing 'em until the day that drake's over the wait's over , the tape's coming they bullshitting , but i am equipped with great plumbing the human mentality , so eager to hate something and try to play it off like it ain't jumping and it's the predicament that you found drake in the condo that i just purchased sound vacant 'cause i have just been sittin' in this cell thinking what i could've done to make my first video groundbreaking and whenever i'm flowing on the mic aside from talking 'bout the d i'm throwing in your wife i treat this one session as if it were my last and i pretend tomorrow is the day i'm going in for life , like that !","['think', 'ready', 'wardrobe', 'right', 'store', 'close', 'blow', 'fee', 'shows', 'song', 'use', 'flows', 'christian', 'wanna', 'shop', 'christian', 'dior', 'clothes', 'like', 'baby', 'cute', 'adore', 'salesman', 'build', 'rapport', 'understand', 'fact', 'spending', 'offshore', 'dough', 'cash', 'transactions', 'homie', 'receipts', 'feds', 'like', 'explore', 'audit', 'nt', 'know', 'bought', 'years', 'homie', 'thoroughly', 'thought', 'currently', 'recording', 'track', 'admitting', 'currency', 'imported', 'late', 'legitimate', 'hit', 'lawsuit', 'acts', 'commit', 'repeat', 'offender', 'anita', 'baker', 'playing', 'whip', 'pull', 'sweet', 'surrender', 'got', 'jewish', 'lawyer', 'lead', 'defender', 'menschkeit', 'legal', 'bender', 'atf', 'present', 'regal', 'member', 'coalition', 'efficient', 'invited', 'admission', 'know', 'tradition', 'spend', 'money', 'try', 'compete', 'position', 'wish', 'listen', 'trial', 'home', 'like', 'new', 'edition', 'foot', 'solely', 'fit', 'shoe', 'fits', 'record', 'basement', 'renny', 'grew', 'piff', 'pops', 'turned', 'keys', 'like', 'new', 'ignition', 'hov', 'jordan', 'guess', 'cool', 'pippen', 'til', 'mention', 'wanna', 'play', 'new', 'position', 'team', 'playing', 'screen', 'setting', 'wanna', 'win', 'games', 'coach', 'assisting', 'takeover', 'break', 'nigga', 'killing', 'day', 'drake', 'wait', 'tape', 'coming', 'bullshitting', 'equipped', 'great', 'plumbing', 'human', 'mentality', 'eager', 'hate', 'try', 'play', 'like', 'ai', 'jumping', 'predicament', 'found', 'drake', 'condo', 'purchased', 'sound', 'vacant', 'sittin', 'cell', 'thinking', 'video', 'groundbreaking', 'flowing', 'mic', 'aside', 'talking', 'd', 'throwing', 'wife', 'treat', 'session', 'pretend', 'tomorrow', 'day', 'going', 'life', 'like']",6,Life & Aspirations
Loving You No More,rap,drake,2010,42090,"[Intro: Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Refrain: Diddy]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try
[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh

[Refrain: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself (no, woah)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more (no, no, baby)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me

[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh
[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money & Drake]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more  (I can't) (Diddy)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure
[Bridge 2: Dirty Money]
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

Closer to My Dreams,rap,drake,2007,164973,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say ""My baby's famous and I knew it"" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And ""Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest""
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home
[Outro: Drake talking]
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on

[Intro]
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on
[Chorus]
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow

The Last Hope,rap,drake,2007,25012,"[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall
[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second

So I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uh, shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy, haha
Here I go!
Uh

[Verse]
Look, I stands out
Don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, hah, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, ""Hey bitches!""
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description, hah
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of OVO
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame?
Cause they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
[Hook]
And all you talking ass niggas, get over it
And all you people that be hating, get over it
And all you women that I fucked, get over it
And yeah, I'm turning 22, get over it
You know you got to hear my records, get over it
My whole team getting rich, get over it
I got the city on my back, get over it
Get over it, get over it

Deceiving,rap,drake,2007,56861,"[Drake: talking]
I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I'd like to ummm
I'd like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess I'll call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments

[Verse 1:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 2:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 3:]
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Drake: talking]
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know

Man of the Year,rap,drake,2007,43416,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright

Barry Bonds Freestyle,rap,drake,2007,40526,"[Verse]
It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, ""No speak-a la ingles""
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke
[Refrain]
Life of a don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds",en,"it's what you all been waiting for , ain't it ? your weekly entertainment for me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head , claim it i'm about to paint a picture , you niggas go 'head , frame it since we getting seinfeld on some jerry and elaine shit i flow far from mediocre and if we talking cards , i will fold him with the poker you and your whole crew are like a deck of 54 so it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers and me , i'm rolling with some brokers like , damn , could you niggas get any broker ? i got my new girl so content just save yourself the embarrassment , don't even approach her disguise yourself , go buy a costume i am making stocks work while you working stock rooms ugh , and i was praying i would drop june but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes so i keep it rocking for pete's sakes you fake gangsta rappers are cliché and if you ain't talking dough when you meet drake i'll be all in your face , like , ""no speak-a la ingles"" soon as you hear it , you quote it they try to be the one that i done left out the show with but trust me , i'm aware , and my car's right there is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives ?

AM 2 PM,rap,drake,2006,31686,"[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club, I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two, my nig, 'bout to be twenty three, ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck
[Chorus: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!
[Chorus: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit

Lust for Life,rap,drake,2009,162503,"[Verse]
I'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?
My ex sendin' late night texts
'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin' in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck
And we only gettin' older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B

Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free

Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between

And you are now hanging with the asthma team

Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears

I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh

My New Shit,rap,drake,2007,19040,"* bonus song off of Comeback Season

[Verse One] [Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby
[Hook]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse Two] [Drake]

But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like �I ain't getting service in your area�
You be like �Nigga get your bars up�
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! (look)
[Hook]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)

Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking, damn, where did they go?
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
And now I see 'em picking up the pieces
One too many starting over speeches
I guess, it’s back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we are growing up
Used to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, it’s whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
But it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I been here before, huh?
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

Come Winter,rap,drake,2006,88855,"[Part 1]

[Intro]
Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen

[Verse 1]
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like ""Where's my hi?""
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
[Interlude]
Yeah man
It's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close
You might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[Verse 2]
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says ""I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat""
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!

[Interlude]
Yeah, uh
I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is
[Verse 3]
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together, it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime

[Outro: Eva Cassidy]
I miss you, most of all, my darling

[Part 2]

[Intro: Drake & Marlena Shaw]
Give me a second to gather my thoughts
Strolling in the park (Ho)
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss
Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby
[Verse: Drake]
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive

know that crew and we'd assembled a trio , a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different it's a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin' crack is a one man sport instead of dress-up , i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' the face , the breast , the bras , the toes i'm still solo and a long night draws to a close cause it's a fact , if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside we'll never talk again , scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through yet i can't seem to find it , every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself , now least there's some room to ride there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive  strolling in the park , and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park , and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park , and watching winter turn to spring","['yeah', 'dedicated',

And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club

Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it’s six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my Asian girls, Dim Sum

Probably some bad hoes, I’m 'bout to take your hemp from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It’s been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning

Who else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane
I'm too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords",en,"who else really try to mess with hollywood cole treating birmingham like my hollywood shows i'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know this that slumdog millionaire bollywood flow and ahh , my real friends never hearing from me fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me that's why i pick and choose i don't get shit confused i'm not with different crews we walk the same paths , but got on different shoes we live in the same building , but we got different views i got a couple cars , i never get to lose don't like my women single , i like my chicks in twos and these days all the girls is down to roll we hit the strip club , and all them girls find a pole tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go tell me today's weather i know they say they good but trust me i'm better i sound like the coldest miami night ever i'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater really this whatever and i am murdering and this is so amusing if there's a sight to see i am an illusion i tell you i'm the man baby , what is the confusion and if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then keep sleeping while i sell a couple million i'm headed for the moon , i ain't bout to hit the ceiling i'm about to hit the club , women tell me i'm appealing but fuck what they say , let me tell you how i'm feeling i'm drinking , these london street lamps got a real glow drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow and ask your man , he's a hater baby he don't know i could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal this here was meant to get buried i got a lot of things , i mention those barely i ain't lyin' to the kids , like the dentist ain't scary i'm what lebron was to st . vincent-st . mary's but i ain't playin' high school games pulling mcclarens through a mcdonald's drive through lane i'm too fly , keep it hip-hop like afu ra girl on that mcclaren , you gotta lift the doors blades chopping through the city streets , liquid swords","['try', 'mess', 'hollywood', 'cole', 'treating', 'birmingham', 'like', 'hollywood', 'shows', 'tryin', 'tell', 'prolly', 'know', 'slumdog', 'millionaire', 'bollywood', 'flow', 'ahh', 'real', 'friends', 'hearing', 'fake', 'friends', 'write', 'wrong', 'answers', 'mirror', 'pick', 'choose', 'shit', 'confused', 'different', 'crews', 'walk', 'paths', 'got', 'different', 'shoes', 'live', 'building', 'got', 'different', 'views', 'got', 'couple', 'cars', 'lose', 'like', 'women', 'single', 'like', 'chicks', 'twos', 'days', 'girls', 'roll', 'hit', 'strip', 'club', 'girls', 'find', 'pole', 'tell', 'girl', 'tell', 'friend', 'time', 'tell', 'today', 'weather', 'know', 'good', 'trust', 'better', 'sound', 'like', 'coldest', 'miami', 'night', 'cold', 'hot', 'decide', 'sweater', 'murdering', 'amusing', 'sight', 'illusion', 'tell', 'man', 'baby', 'confusion', 'sleeping', 'hit', 'snooze', 'sleeping', 'sell', 'couple', 'million', 'headed', 'moon', 'ai', 'bout', 'hit', 'ceiling', 'hit', 'club', 'women', 'tell', 'appealing', 'fuck', 'let', 'tell', 'feeling', 'drinking', 'london', 'street', 'lamps', 'got', 'real', 'glow', 'drizzy', 'playin', 'driving', 'fast', 'feels', 'slow', 'ask', 'man', 'hater', 'baby', 'know', 'kick', 'punt', 'turn', 'shit', 'field', 'goal', 'meant', 'buried', 'got', 'lot', 'things', 'mention', 'barely', 'ai', 'lyin', 'kids', 'like', 'dentist', 'ai', 'scary', 'lebron', 'st', 'vincent', 'st', 'mary', 'ai', 'playin', 'high', 'school', 'games', 'pulling', 'mcclarens', 'mcdonald', 'drive', 'lane', 'fly', 'hip', 'hop', 'like', 'afu', 'ra', 'girl', 'mcclaren', 'got', 'ta', 'lift', 'doors', 'blades', 'chopping', 'city', 'streets', 'liquid', 'swords']",2,Identity & Recognition

Please

[Verse 1: Drake]
D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin' ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin' hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb
[Chorus: Drake]
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
I just set the 40 ups, and I got two blunts
Bagging sour diesel, stinking like I got a few stumps
I’m sipping on lean, while you got fruit punch
Getting faded like clothes, I’ve been washed too much
Man, smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it’s a halo
Wake up, and bake up, spend the whole day slow
Head in the clouds, but my face low
Ayo, I got them percocets, you want a percocet?
Yo' girl got some nice titties, yeah, a perky set
I purchase cess ‘cause everyday I work with stress
High while I’m driving, it’s like I’m triyn’ to work a jet
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay low-key like Ja Rule new name
And I can barely walk, but it’s all good and dandy
Man, I’m so high I need a pilot to land me
[Chorus: Drake]
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created

Where to Now,rap,drake,2007,77063,"[Intro: Drake talking]
Okay...
There comes a time...
When you gotta be like
You know, I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now, you know?
But I just—I just tell myself this one thing

[Verse: Drake]
It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time, I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit, but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My sixteens should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah, Heartbreak Drake, I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse, then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight
Go—Go—Go—Goddamn, how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over, watch a season of Flight of the Conchords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But ugh, tell me you surfing, let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes, I swear to God, girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Fords
Ethiopian girl, Ethiopian girl
With your long, curly hair and yo' big ass boo-tay
Reading all them pro-Black, pro-female books
Just let 'em, let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription, a vision correction

Take what you want, take what you want

But, you gotta share it with the world

[Verse: Drake]
Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball

The Presentation,rap,drake,2007,62370,"[Produced By Rich Kidd]

[Verse 1]
Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, ""Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?""
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin ""white Phantom sittin' on dub"" money
I am talkin ""cold champagne at the club"" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from
[Interlude]
Oh! Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity
To formally welcome you to this extravaganza
That I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay
Drinks are on me, by the way, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise
[Outro]

City Is Mine,rap,drake,2006,70242,"[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, I just got clean rap
I don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me
[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)

What Im Thinkin Right Now,rap,drake,2011,31805,"[Intro]
Yes

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dame's shit
Talking 'bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I should've went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but I'm the same, I will remain this
I'm still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 Laws if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons I'm level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me ""He who made it by struggling made it the best""
So with that on my chest, I'm down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs, and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin' good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we don't read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin' that new age look
If I said I liked it, I'd feel like a two-faced crook
Nah, I tell retro kids tie that bandana just a little bit tighter

Sooner Than Later,rap,drake,2009,193769,"[Verse 1]
Uh
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Chorus]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
[Verse 2]
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
[Verse 3]
The girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?
Night's fallin', lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear

I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
She could be good for me yeahh
That's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin' in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh

Replacement Girl,rap,drake,2007,92993,"[Intro: Trey Songz]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

[Verse 1: Drake & Trey Songz]
Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white sneaks to Louis
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn
And all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
And now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females
Females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't, now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly? (Probably not)
Lookin' for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life (She gone)
Tryna find another one tonight
And if it's you baby, let yourself be seen
Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans
I got that work, know what I mean
And I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what I mean

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl
[Verse 3: Drake]
With the other dudes she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and then they break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heatstroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't , now you don’t
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

But it's you I wanna take apart

Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby

We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a

So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask
[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late

[Bridge]
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Show me if this is brand new (Brand new)

Lets Call It Off,rap,drake,2009,110275,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, ""This just ain't my style""
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile for me, no

Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that

I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah

Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh
[Hook]
(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em V; I need somebody special in you girl)
I need someone special in you
(I know they out there somewhere dude; Ho!)
I know that out there theres a few
(Put ya hands up ladies; Yeah man)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?
(Uh)
She gotta be special
(Yea; You gotta hold me down baby)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
You gotta be special
(Yeah; You never know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 2: Drake]
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh
(Yea; uh)
You can just love me like they do
(Vo we back man; Its a beautiful thing dog)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; I'm looking for somebody special man I'm serious; Ho!)
I know that out there, theres a few
(I know that they out there man)
See I've been searching, I dont know what to do
(Ho! You gotta help me man)
Can you help me?
(Uh)

(Uh; yea; I need you to hold me down babe)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)

(Yeah; You never really know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh
(Yep; ho!; Were makin history right now man)
You can't just love me like they do
(Yea; And you a legend for real, ima give you that man)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; Yea; I know they out there man)

(Ho!; Yeah uh)

Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 2]
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own
[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby (Yeah)
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at (Oh)
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at (Oh)
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back (Uh)

[Bridge]
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Easy baby (It what it is)
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Easy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

S.T.R.E.S.S.,rap,drake,2006,21077,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But
[Hook: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a ""nigga""
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
[Hook: Nickelus F]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

Uh, yea, get in my Slick Rick mode
N'a mean?, I'm a tell ya a Story real quick

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a
[Chorus: Sean G. & Drake]
Video girl
Eh, yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[Verse 2: Drake]
My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it, I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill
[Chorus: Sean G. & Drake]

Eh, yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position

And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
Accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
Video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh
And she beautiful and honey dances
And you always downtown making money transfers
And anything the color of braces she get excited
She always showing up at these places she get invited

A Night Off,rap,drake,2009,97271,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

[Chorus: Drake]
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
[Verse 2: Lloyd]
I been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl, I'm gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do

Try Harder,rap,drake,2006,13257,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try
[Verse 2: Drake]
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

Thrill Is Gone,rap,drake,2006,16333,"[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
[Refrain: Drake]
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 2: Drake]
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces, circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like MacGyver, cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple of years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls

[Refrain: Drake]
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 3: Drake]
Check
And nowadays, some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it, see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing, ger reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
[Refrain: Drake]
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

A Scorpios Mind,rap,drake,2006,49984,"[Intro: Nickelus F]
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day
[Verse 2: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, ""I expected this""
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar

Friends With Money,rap,drake,2008,16045,"[Intro]
D-D-D-Do that

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 1]
Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
""Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!""
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' (damn)
[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look
Me and 40 whilin', stylin'
Somehwere on the island
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm throwed up
Tone it all down
My nigga grow up
And tell me when you start getting paid to show up, damn
[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!

Teach You A Lesson,rap,drake,2011,29242,"[VERSE 1]
Man, you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm in the fresh and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mine is Polo, and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
[VERSE 2]
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would

[Hook]
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

[BRIDGE]
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

[VERSE 3]
You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
So you can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
Girl can I frisk you?
Search you body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause your hiding ?
And I'm going to sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
[Hook]
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

[BRIDGE]
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

Good Night and Good Luck,rap,drake,2008,41759,"I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo', converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you

Stunt Hard,rap,drake,2009,23431,"[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (yeah)
If I ever disappear (look), best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again (yeah)
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 1: Drake]
I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who is he?""
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully live to see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall
Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all
[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear (yeah), best believe I'm comin' back
Stunt hard (I'm leanin')
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
If I don't do nothin', I'mma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel and I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles, I need a stunt double
Yeah, me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah, I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah, but I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O, yeah
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah, I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me I'll say fuck you like wilt
Yeah! I'm a wilderbeast. You're just a wildebeest
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace
Yeah! Talkin big big shit
I am rude, I take food from a kid picnic nigga
Yeah and we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars, haha
[Chorus: Drake & Nutt Da Kid]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (haan)
If I ever disappear ('bout time)
Best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard (they'll know)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (yeah, okay)
All I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 3: Nutt Da Kid]
I stunt hard, I stunt harder
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans
I ball hard, So I'm a ball hogger
And I go hard in my dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder, I live in the Carter
I think forward, all I see is tomorrow
I need meat I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you tryin' to see more, better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like ""Izzy"" after ""gr""
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur
And the feds will never get me like a backwards password
Black spur, ghost I'm like Pacman, Casper
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister
Ask her, am I her man? Her answer is yessir
Shit, I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA 'bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches
[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne

Belly Shit,rap,drake,2009,8429,"[Verse 1]
Shit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like
[Refrain]
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

[Belly]
Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up
[Refrain]
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done

Do What You Do Remix,rap,drake,2007,13222,"[Intro: Drake]
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

[Verse 1: No Malice]
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do
[Bridge]
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

[Chorus: Drake]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2: Drake]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!
[Chorus: Drake]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 3: Nickelus F]
Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice
[Chorus: Drake]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball

Dont You Have a Man,rap,drake,2007,34071,"[Chorus: Dwele & Drake]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl? (Yeah)
I can't believe it (I know you got a man)
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything (Kick it to you like this)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you over there looking at me
While your man standing right beside you?
The temporary happiness he might provide you
But you know and I know that nobody gon' do you like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly, I'm kinda like
I don't really wanna hit this girl
And still, she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing around
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...
[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 2: Big Pooh]
Look, we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreating
But that was then, you know, some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus, your man still there, let's be fair
You'd do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past some late-nigh- smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he
Late nights, 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, 'cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me with your silly lil' plan
It's my bad, should've chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl, playing
I'm saying, you need to do what you do
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon
[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man?
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Ugh, ugh, I met her at the bar, sipping on Patrón
And now, it's been three years off and on
'Cause the same page, we are rarely often on
'Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (C'mon)
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was building a house and home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that she don't know what to do with her life
'Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute, she mad at me; next minute, it's all good
And I'm in her body like ""Gray's Anatomy""
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (Ugh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, ""Damn, if only her nigga knew,"" but...
(Hahaha, yeah)
[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)

We can do anything
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)

Easy to Please,rap,drake,2007,11012,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's
[Chorus: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

[Verse 2: Richie Sosa]
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up
[Chorus: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys

Missin You Freestyle,rap,drake,2007,38667,"[Intro: Trey Songz]
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Drake]
Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
'Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus
[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you outta my mind

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Missin' everything you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby '07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
'Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?

Must Hate Money,rap,drake,2007,21027,"[Intro: Drake]
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when ""fuck bitches, get money"" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single
[Chorus: Drake]
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker(so)
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice

[Chorus: Drake]
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

[Chorus: Drake]

Teach U a Lesson Freestyle,rap,drake,2007,12981,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You work it off (work it off)
Baby I can give you extra credit (extra credit)
But there's something else
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause you're hidin' WMD's
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby, you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

Yeah Man (Aye)
You already know what it is (Aye)
Trey called Trigga (Aye)
Aye man (Aye)
Show them why you rappin' homie (Aye)
Look

[Chorus: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Just copped new shoes
Whip on two two's
Dick down you two
Throw it on YouTube
Tell me what you'd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal, stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta mañana though, hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the Reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it ain't a city I ain't never been
Scared I ain't never been
Yea I ain't never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under ya'll
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwear
Still in the hood yeah
I ain't talking outerwear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cause I'm with it
Fuck ya'll, the underdog
[Chorus: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop

You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 2: Drake]
Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never rendezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's 'bout
I mean for tonight hoe
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

New Shit,rap,drake,2007,11013,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
[Verse 2: Von Pea]
It's been a couple weeks out travelin' and this broad
I've seen a couple freaks out battlin' for discharge it's odd
I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some, I have desired some, but that time is done
Now I am gon' give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical, maybe if we spend
A few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures, this bruh took a good game
But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin', I know I be playin' too much
But I'd rather go deaf than loose touch, holla at me

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
[Verse 3: Phonte]
Round, round, round, round, round
Ayo, the same chick from ""Don't you have a man?"" ""Well...""
It all blowed over like Manuel Noriega
She said she wouldn't marry the player
But she's the Tamia to his Grant Hill, man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, ""That ain't enough protection
I need +Affection+ like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I can't be mad at this thing that you got
I'll lace you up but I ain't tryin' to tie the knot, so ah
From me you won't hear no more questions
And please understand that you got my blessings
I hope that your new love opens doors
And is everything that you hopin' for
But you can't get my new shit, girl you spoken for

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
[Verse 4: Drake]
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like ""I ain't getting service in your area""
You be like ""Nigga get your bars up""
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong, I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch, holla at me baby! (look)

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service

Think Good Thoughts,rap,drake,2007,43514,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
9th Wonder
Don't judge me, man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El 'bout to prove 'em wrong, though

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 2: Phonte]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, 'cause I ain't dumb, shit, I'm well-read like sunburn
And after me, you'll never leave no stone unturned
[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Yeah, they say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying, so they coming off paper-thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down
To see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle
To get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play
But your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now, I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback, that's written all over your face
No, El will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love

Fancy Remix,rap,drake,2010,27094,"[Produced by Swizz Beatz and Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Hook: Swizz Beatz x2]
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, every thing big
Nails done, hair done, everything big

[Verse 1: Drake]
You gettin' ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spendin' hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you’re the fuckin' coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together
[Hook: Swizz Beatz x2]

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
She got it all together
She dont need to help none
She got her own paper
She dont need you to taker her
On a shopping spreee
My girl is fancy, fly and free
For some Gucci, huh
For some Louis huh
She got the best of everything
You can never report a fancy girl like me

[Hook: Swizz Beatz x2]

[Interlude: Drake]
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

[Verse 2: Drake]
They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game, ah
[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know

[Bridge: Voyce]
Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!

Money Remix,rap,drake,2006,10720,"[Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Intro: Drake]
Southern Smoke
It's Southern Smoke baby!
(Money) Frank Dukes
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke

[Verse 1: Drake]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!
[Chorus: Drake]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me, homie

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
Money’s the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benz’s comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind (Money)
I’ll blow your mind all over the money that’s on your mind (Money)
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head (Money)
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga
[Chorus: Drake]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money), yeah
Switch countries exchange that (Money), uh
You cannot get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right, uh
There's, no need to stash right, right
Got the same, four G's from last night, uh
You cannot take that from me, homie

Make Things Right,rap,drake,2006,13221,"[Chorus: Drake]
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm from the city where
People be gettin' lazy, litterin' in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers, money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams and dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events, bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot, so girls'll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane and she back where she was
Right back on the bus, it's a shame cause now
At his window she throwin' bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see that's shes colder 'cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her that he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say
[Chorus: Drake]
If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience

To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

[Verse 2: Drake]
Now up north there's five artists deservin' a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through chances are that it ain't you
I single-handedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out and the plan's seeming ill
Whenever I'm out in Memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm Andreena mill
Japan and Brazil, the audience screaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

Bad Meaning Good,rap,drake,2006,22593,"[Verse 1: Slakah]
Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin, it's obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby and people are shady

[Bridge: Drake]
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at

[Chorus: Drake]
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
[Verse 2: Slakah]
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next, klend me ya Kleenex
I'm tellin you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you, I hope that I see you again
A-a-again
Hope that I see you, see you

Don't put it past them

Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Verse 3: Drake]
Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on Pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
Specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin' they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these youngins get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could

Unstoppable,rap,drake,2009,83838,"[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'

And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit, like, ""a-la-la-lollipop""
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick

Give me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race

Part of me wish that I could meet with all you haters in person
They got a lot of feelings for me they just ain't certain
How to express themself when I walk into the club
And take stares like the fuckin elevators ain't workin', yeah
'Cause they know the promoter paid you
You wouldn’t have come if someone hadn’t of made you
You just lookin' forward to seein' woman that played you
And shittin' on the men they get engaged to
I swear it’s like, uh
More confidence and less fear
We can discuss it further when y'all manage to get here
Diddy here, O here, Skinny here, Rex here
And we just havin' one of those conversations 'bout next year
I'ma kill it I promise this how I know you mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much all I want is the

Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

She be jumping up and down
Trynna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
Cause her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
I’m the only one she loves
There’s no copies of the key
Homie, that’s a guarantee

[Verse 2]
Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
Don’t know where she’s going
And I do not plan on asking at all

Where Were You Original,rap,drake,2011,10000,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
(I love the line about the range with the rims to match)
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…

[Chorus: Drake & Colin Munroe]
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…
[Verse 2: Drake]
Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it'll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah

Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled ""Surprise!"", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Of course...
[Chorus]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Aw, yeah
[Chorus: Jai Paul]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?

[Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever
Four page letters, and time is all better
‘Cause time heal whatever
Ima need a moment ’cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, Females are on a regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friend with benefits till we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like “one more chance”, more problems no biggie ah
It’s all good don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give eachother space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that (all that)
Tell your friends they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?

Heard you gotta ballplayer, but he don’t excite you
I ain’t the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Uh, still a, still a superfreak
You know how it be when I’m rolling in the sheets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Genuine, ’cause I’m the same O G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies
Arguing in Barney’s, fly shit, too much pride to say sorry
Problems ruined like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave, but she wanna stay
She like, how you feeling babe?
Like, like, shit

Alright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario

Said I’m up too high somebody get me down down down down

Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low

They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on
[Drake & Saukrates: Hook]
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all

[Verse 2: Saukrates]
Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up
See where we from, the 50's are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
I'm off the chain, come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drake'll give you the deal
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one

But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping

But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh
[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Runaway Girl,rap,drake,2011,7980,"Hey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing now

Are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
The passport you carry in your purse is
The gift in the curse when you going head first is
The ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
Luggage all packed and to them I say
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray

You wander the world
You seek what you've lost
You're waking up every day
The run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
The run away, the run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on
Your way
Run away girl

Watching it all through the window
And wishing you could make it shatter now
Now that you're here on the other side
Are you sure it even matters

Are you living the dream
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
Do you strip do you model do you live in between
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like

You wander the world
You seek what you lost
You're waking up every day
To run away, run away girl

Pen
I need Rose, nevermind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom no license
Fuck if you're feelin me as long as your wife is
No one in my city gotta pocket like Drizzy
I can rock fitted Jeans cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentials
And Ms. Rhone sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck ya rappers and your self-proclaimed status

Check the soundscan and you can see that I'm the last hope

Goin through it
Tryna re-invent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light skinned young'n on some

Cos I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
And you are in my age bracket, you are not my peer

Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake, but a nigga's livin' ya dreams out

It's fuckin' losers like you that make me do what I do
Make me hate where I'm from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got songs, but you ain't fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me what's it about
While you're tryna get in we're all tryna get out
Why don't you just be yourself, why don't you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You ain't nothin' to shoot, you don't even exist
You're just a fantasy family as weak as it gets
And you ain't speakin' to Bish, cause I don't listen to chicks
I don't argue with broads, cause I'm really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as y'all are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause y'all are nothing but Who's
Just another bunch of low life's with nothing to do

[Verse 2: Ken Masters]
Now let the kids play like the rider's ride
We spendin' all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon' make 'em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin' by
But run up on 'em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
My niggas, we ride or die
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break a nigga's spirit like the Amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Ain't gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swagger's on Mars
Y'all niggas ain't thinking we calling y'all 'tards
Claim you want war, okay, on guard

Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, story tellin' when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
There's another lie, couldn't out-hustle me
Hatin' when it come to D, I can take you're starting 5
I'm only goin' at generic rap niggas that
Rap about ki's but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga' dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the D's
My nigga please, if you really had work
You would do what you do and wouldn't put it on your shirt
It makes my heart hurt when dumb niggas act hood
You ain't no hustla, just a nigga that can rap good

[Verse 4: Jonny Roxx]
See there's a height requirement, nigga to mention my name (smarten up)
How the fuck you little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I don't get it, nigga I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat y'all sweet niggas
Every time I see y'all retard niggas y'all bitch out
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
Talkin' all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin' you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
I'm saying, we don't believe y'all niggas (nah)
G-35, x5 nah niggas (yeah)
This here is a public announcement for my niggas (yeah)
No more goodnight, good mornin', goodbye niggas
[Verse 5: JD Era]
I don't appreciate niggas sayin' my name in they bullshit
It's like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
If I was rapping like y'all I woulda killed myself
And nah, this ain't beef, it's missing a few ingredients
Dog you ain't a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that ain't something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you should'a seen how I was laughing at you
I don't beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm addressin' it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then I'm suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge 'em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?

[Verse 6: Drake]
Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat (it's true)
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity (what up Littles)
'Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma (Tony!)
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea (I know about it)
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign (nobody)
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant (damn)
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free (what up sweetheart)
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids ""Mr. Wishheart"" (what up Cam)
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school (I did)
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
'Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you (it's true)
With what I spend in a weekend I could acquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales

Give Ya,rap,drake,2007,30256,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Hennessy, straight, no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? They call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)
It ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything,"" money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake,"" girl, don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap-opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
[Outro]
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything,"" money on my mind
Mind, mind-mind
Tell 'em I apologize, it happened over time
Time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know

Drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner

Scriptures,rap,drake,2009,21908,"[Verse 1]
Look, here we go
The first time around
I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I've been thinking before y'all
I barely get tired I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what I'm daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look
[Verse 2]
I'm making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital I'm caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again
D.R.A. you add a K.E
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me
I never go broke I'm far from a flash in the pan
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand
Uh

[Verse 3]
I got few days left
But I'mma make use of every single one until every singles done
Until every record is sold, and every string is strung
Tell me take a breather Drake and everything will come
Dog its always been the same
Its all love like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway
I roll down strips and hose down whips
That when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond
With no down shifting
Haters would say I'm adequate
Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit
21 years I've been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus I'm changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out
But rich is how we all ending up

Doing It Wrong,rap,drake,2011,1845237,"[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, ""I love you too""

But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh
[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you

Still Drake,rap,drake,2011,27895,"[Verse 1:Trey songz]

Still...

Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
It's still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin' there ain't a lot of dudes
That don't like the fact I'm blowin'
Like some running shoes on the track I'm goin'
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin'
Don't get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind it's the winter time all the time
I'm a grind
Tell em I'm a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and it's wild cause I'm still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I don't be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell em what the fuck is up
[Verse 2: Drake]
I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights on
Just to let em know their foresight's wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, I'm tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin', hattenin'
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and, it couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish (ha)
Yea, what about the grammy's and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me, I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass
But you ain't give me yo number cause them niggas got to fighting
Situation got me thinking and that's when I got to writing, hmm...
Change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year, yeah
And what it look like hun'
I never got to make it rain but it look like fun
And, uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggas, they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it its private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way

Club Paradise,rap,drake,2011,726872,"[Intro]
Ha, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, ""Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?""
They said, ""Fucking right, they were the first to go""
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you""
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, ""Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?""
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
[Verse 2]
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home
[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 3]
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?""
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home
[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Outro: Bob Marley]
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians – them know it, but them can't do it

Tell a bad bitch ""Girl, let's go hang""

Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and Screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Now, let me gon' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything to make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe but I'm living dangerous

I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My momma still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap-dance to my drum roll (Uh)
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled

But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make do with what's left

The Real Her,rap,drake,2011,1388870,"[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

[Chorus: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other

You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
'Cause to her, I'm just a rapper and soon, she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow, we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wan' be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her
And she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, ""That ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
""Someone Like You,"" more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy

Shot for Me,rap,drake,2011,2106160,"[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh, you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah, I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me
That's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always gettin' faded

[Verse 2]
Okay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says, ""I know you changed
I never see you 'cause you're always busy doin' things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewin' things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends tellin' you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr. Perfect
I could tell that you been cryin' all night, drinkin' all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Buried Alive Interlude,rap,drake,2011,839499,"[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]

I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and, and fall asleep, I, I fall asleep
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause you, 'cause you are the death of me

'Cause you are the—
The, the death of me, you, you, the death of me

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man, arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it, I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar
Women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all 'cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat, capitalize that
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 Series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as
Myself, and it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend say she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died",en,"box i would surely break the lock i'd jump right in and , and fall asleep , i , i fall asleep 'cause , 'cause , 'cause you , 'cause you are the death of me 'cause you are the— if you was in a pine box , box i would surely break the lock i'd jump right in and , and fall asleep , i , i fall asleep 'cause , 'cause , 'cause you , 'cause you are the death of me 'cause you are the— the , the death of me , you , you , the death of me  lookin' in the mirror , i'm embarrassed i'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist react like an infant whenever you are mentioned mind over matter never worked for my nemesis i'm in the matter of man , arm wrestlin' hands i was dealt when i said the music business was all i needed when i got it , i was greeted by an alien that said last year that she slept with a canadian that gave him an addiction that'd keep him in mercedes benz bright lights and rihanna as a lady friend my vice is similar women love when you're my type and you're winnin' from everything that your palm write put her in the palms hotel , sin city devil in a dress , platinum chanel live the ambiance all 'cause the audience one day said i would do it so instead of a verse bein' read i'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music i tell a bad bitch your ass too fat , capitalize that and your weave look good with the indian tracks trackin' device on your used 5 series i don't call back , just blame it on your canadian the same day we say we in the area cruisin' in toronto hit me on the cellular , thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers i know sat down with a few drinks , located where you can't see us a white waitress on standby when we need her a black maybach , 40 pulled up jeep no doors , all that nigga was missin' was aaliyah felt like the initiation , a reality livin' in the matrix we talk casually about the industry and how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin' then he said that he was the same age as myself , and it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient so blame it on mr . ovoxo the reason why i'm breathin' all the vanity i know the reason why my best friend say she love me more than life but i live a double life and need to let her go the reason why the highlight was when he said you belong to the people when you outside so dig a shovel full of money , full of power , full of pussy full of fame and bury yourself alive , then i died","['box', 'surely', 'break', 'lock', 'jump', 'right', 'fall', 'asleep', 'fall', 'asleep', 'death', 'pine', 'box', 'box', 'surely', 'break', 'lock', 'jump', 'right', 'fall', 'asleep', 'fall', 'asleep', 'death', 'death', 'death', 'lookin', 'mirror', 'embarrassed', 'feelin', 'like', 'suicidal', 'terrorist', 'react', 'like', 'infant', 'mentioned', 'mind', 'matter', 'worked', 'nemesis', 'matter', 'man', 'arm', 'wrestlin', 'hands', 'dealt', 'said', 'music', 'business', 'needed', 'got', 'greeted', 'alien', 'said', 'year', 'slept', 'canadian', 'gave', 'addiction', 'mercedes', 'benz', 'bright', 'lights', 'rihanna', 'lady', 'friend', 'vice', 'similar', 'women', 'love', 'type', 'winnin', 'palm', 'write', 'palms', 'hotel', 'sin', 'city', 'devil', 'dress', 'platinum', 'chanel', 'live', 'ambiance', 'audience', 'day', 'said', 'instead', 'verse', 'bein', 'read', 'head', 'strength', 'music', 'tell', 'bad', 'bitch', 'ass', 'fat', 'capitalize', 'weave', 'look', 'good', 'indian', 'tracks', 'trackin', 'device', 'series', 'blame', 'canadian', 'day', 'area', 'cruisin', 'toronto', 'hit', 'cellular', 'thought', 'gon', 'na', 'sell', 'false', 'word', 'like', 'rappers', 'know', 'sat', 'drinks', 'located', 'white', 'waitress', 'standby', 'need', 'black', 'maybach', 'pulled', 'jeep', 'doors', 'nigga', 'missin', 'aaliyah', 'felt', 'like', 'initiation', 'reality', 'livin', 'matrix', 'talk', 'casually', 'industry', 'women', 'tastemakers', 'shit', 'makin', 'said', 'age', 'help', 'rude', 'impatient', 'blame', 'mr', 'ovoxo', 'reason', 'breathin', 'vanity', 'know', 'reason', 'best', 'friend', 'love', 'life', 'live', 'double', 'life', 'need', 'let', 'reason', 'highlight', 'said', 'belong', 'people', 'outside', 'dig', 'shovel', 'money', 'power', 'pussy', 'fame', 'bury', 'alive', 'died']",1,Emotional Connections
The Ride,rap,drake,2011,749353,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me, man
I hate that shit
It'll be a long time before y'all feel me
If ever
For real

[Verse 1: Drake]
You won't feel me 'til everybody say they love you, but it's not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fuckin' hates you and your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend ass keep gettin' thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop, but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit right up your alley
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
'Stead of gettin' a pat-down, they just keep on sayin' that they feel you, nigga, yeah
It's been too long
Been way too long
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? Ooh, the ride

[Verse 2: Drake]
You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad, you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit card so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
Where you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you gettin' close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Tellin' stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on tellin' you they feel you, nigga
Yeah
It's been too long, man
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Drake]
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh

Why won't it stop? (Uh), ooh, the ride

[Verse 3: Drake]
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I'm drivin' right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold, especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking what's good at home?
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I should've known
My young niggas poppin' M's and sippin' dirty Jones
Problem children that all be reppin' October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growin'
Brand new titties, stitches still showin'
Yeah, and she just prayin' that it heals good
I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just prayin' that it feels good
I really don't know much, but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money, more problems, my nigga, don't believe it
I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evadin'
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazin'
Young money-maker, season-ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches, still scorchin' as if I didn't notice
You niggas gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas that couldn't fuck with my freshman floater
Look at that fuckin' chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My junior and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

Lord Knows,rap,drake,2011,982792,"[Intro: Choir & Rick Ross]
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (All we wanted was an opportunity)
Just Blaze (Lord knows)

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bought 'em sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields, they makin' the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (Woo)
Places they say they've been, we actually goin' for real (Woo)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin' (Woo)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (Huh)
With my new bitch that's livin' in Palm Springs
Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at
Never the flow, though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson, boost the rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real
[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Huh
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard, my nigga
I swear, homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
(M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fuckin' the ink (Huh)
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (Woo)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival Cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (Huh), came to buy the bar (Huh)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (Woo)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double-R (Woo)
Headlights flickin', lookin' like a falling star
Every day, them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae
I run the game, but the ladies think I'm runnin' game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate

Hi, I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
'Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ladies up north represent representing
Ladies down south represent representing
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B For President, it's evident
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that
They say that she should be a model she's above that
She had a rapper break her heart, had to open her
So she don't even mess with rap, only spoken word
Well, I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down
And after all this is my city I could show you round
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti
Or sit back relax, vibe with ya man
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan
'Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric
That's why I got a bottle of Champagne and then I sent it
Over where you sitting, noticed, pretend you didn't
Along with the bottle was a note attached
Here's some tickets to my show you should go to that
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her
I'm tryna treat her right 'cause she barely treated proper
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear
You really came to kick it it with Drake, Voyce and Amir like

A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard, knowing you
Weekend in Miami, tryna study by the pool
Couple things due, but you always get it done
Might've been a time where I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in they life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wonderin' what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddling
And my shit's so wet, you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team, so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominatin' every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly, I'm flyin' high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
Could be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guardin'?
Double-D up, hoes, Dolly Parton
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

[Bridge: Drake]
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so—

Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa

I want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar

My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me

The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get they cash

Hope my city's reputation for the summer's gonna change

Cause if you ain't around I'll bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside she'll stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, uh
I'm feelin' you, guaranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! But I guess it's just the pimp in me
All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I ain't worried it's gon' happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living separate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate
I ain't a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!
Lyrics from Snippet 2

I wouldn't be me if I didn't get a little nasty
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na hey
They say all I talk about is sex

Verse (Trey Songz):
How 'bout we just pull over and do it where we at
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up, ooh we can be bad
That place that ain't been touched, I'm feelin on it
All that juicy fruit, keep spillin' on it
Girl, giddyup, get it up take me on a ride to extacy
You don't wanna pump pump then take a nap
You just wanna pump pump, bring it right back
Watch me (Watch me), Im'a heat it up beat it up

Hook:
Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon feel something unusual
Verse (Trey Songz):
I want to do the freaky things you never do
What if we did it while your friends was in the room
Is that too much for ya?
Don't you feel bad, let them see your sexy ass
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain't got to know (no)
Watch me heat it up beat it up
Hey, do you hear me girl
Woah watch me heat it up beat it up

Hook:

Bridge:
Restaurants (check), Cinemas (check)
On the hood (check) of the car
Counter top (check), Balcony (check)
In the jet (check), On the beach (leggo)

Rap (Drake):
This that other shit, You know your asked for it
I might just send you some money to get your passport
So you can come to my city, I'll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony just don't fall over
Send me your picture baby you know I'll never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughin' out loud, I'm serious
Bring your girl if she's a little bi-curious
Please, please no story tellin' to others
I promise you gon' love it
I would never let you down
Feel like I might have perfected all the things that you expected
You gon know it when you bring your ass around

Do it all different ways or different places
Look at the many love faces your makin'
But can you take it

The Motto,rap,drake,2011,3544292,"[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?
[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One time, fuck one time
I'm callin' niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy, so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall, put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, doorknob
Talk stupid, off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer Bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue-kiss her other tongue
Skeet, skeet, skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, Tunechi

Yeah

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight, ah
Fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot, but I'm the truth, that's right, I fuckin' said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You, girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know? How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin'
Rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, ""Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga,"" ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways
[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowin' in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowin' in the South
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like?
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turnin' papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm livin'
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways
[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga

Well Be Fine,rap,drake,2011,779621,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it, and here I am
In the presidential, do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing movin' through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast, Lord
Seem like yesterday that I was up-and-coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here? The drink here? The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then
[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Used to make us proud, we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man, uh
You keep talking how you was this and you had this
And you deserve some fuckin' credit, how did anyone forget it?
Got a show up in your city, your girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfuckin' time
You should take it as a sign, man, I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it, 'cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She says, ""You're such a dog,"" I say, ""You're such a bone""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days, women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, ""Show me some""
But girl, you ain't the only one that's tryna be the only one, uh
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then
[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)

Yeah

Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, aw, yeah

Look What Youve Done,rap,drake,2011,1821683,"[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Man

[Verse 1]
It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should've known
'Cause you deserve it
[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it
[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've

[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey
I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that
So God bless you

What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland

Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, ""Your lyrics do shit for me""
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

The Motto Remix,rap,drake,2011,347838,"[Produced by T-Minus]

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody actin' like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke, ""I'm out in Miami, too""
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay""
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fuckin' with her, I don't really need her, aw
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?
[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet, skeet, skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, Tunechi!
[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 3: Tyga]
T-Raww, skinny nigga, big balls
Fuck around and get dragged: RuPaul
You funny little nigga, Duval
Out of this world, Total Recall
Call a bitch, ride dick like a seesaw
Sorta like a donkey, act a ass nigga hee-haw
Ridin round in the ‘rarri wit the top off
While you in the window, man I’m probably on my next car
Aight, mighty duck with the ice on
Real LA nigga, chucks with the gun drawn
Drawing on your face you’re a clown jack in the box
Boy that’s your bop, she my new pum pum star
Stars in the back, them my homies, they don’t act
Acting brand new, fuck her never call her back
Matt Forte got the bitch running back
Damn, That’s the motto you don’t know it’s like that
[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day

Hate Sleeping Alone,rap,drake,2011,1272841,"[Verse 1]
She says, ""Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me""
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off-topic, don't I? I get it poppin', don't I?
I'll end up stoppin', won't I?
And by the time I end up stoppin'
You'll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out while shoppin' with a nigga, don't lie
Uh, she's losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now, oh
[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she's here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you're over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with your shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make, I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now, oh
[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she's here and we're both so gone

Over My Dead Body,rap,drake,2011,2510453,"[Intro: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry?""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year
Man, fuck it, I was on, though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong, though
Shout out to all my niggas livin' tax-free
Nowadays, it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I'm just playin' the field, nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussin' my career again?
Askin' if I'll be goin' platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man, all of your flows bore me, paint dryin'
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearin' the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yeah
It's been that way from the beginnin'
I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin'
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
[Chorus: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 2: Drake]
You say I'm old news, well, who the new star?
'Cause if I'm goin' anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over fed time
But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfuckin' funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feelin' good, livin' better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back pavin' the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinkin' at the Palms last night
And ended up losin' everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
[Verse 2: Drake]
But don't you go getting married
Don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older
Don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer
But you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it
I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

Ladies and Gentlemen
We are now broadcastin live from London England

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back then it was me plus you, we us two did every single thing that we must do
You trust me, me trust you, plus there's no one else that I see just you
Now a days I'm riding on the bandwagon driver of a porche caiyan wagon
Ice in the necklace light skinned and hectic and all these simple things got a man braggin
And boastin a little never drank much in the past but now they got the kid toastin a little
So cheers to the fact you here in the track you shoulda been shotgun his career in the back
And his two month lease expires right now knew I shoulda got me a truck with two front seats I assume it's
Done I'm lookin at my passenger side I realize that there's room for one oh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

Now a days you be all cried out no more tears no more planes cause you all flyed out
Need the lord in your life on a Sunday no more fashion nomore spendin your life on the runway
Deal with it you hardly can all this hype around Drake whatever happened to Aubrey Graham
Well it's her he’s needin you gotta say leave in the word but I know leavin has crossed your mind
You jealous of some autographs I often sign I try to make it to dinner never often time
But I often find myself hearin your voice you said you never felt a touch soft as mine
I was sayin how the range and the loft is mine had to change in the planes and the porche is mine
It's a deal I was forced to sign but I never imagined that youd end up fourth in line no

[Verse 3: Voyce]
Shes got a feelin lonely (feelin lonely)
Like she don't even know me (don't even know me)
I thought that she would be the one for me but now I see that
If I could turn back the hands of time she would be mine
You’re on my mind girl let's rewind it back

Look this for that girl that you use to see for anybody that want it how it use
To be all the love afection and all the cash I wanna rewind but we movin forward fast

And I adore all the pictures that everyone in the media is dyin for
Back when there was one camera to smile for
There was only couple things I could buy you compared to now where I'm kinda like heres a thou
Drop grands through appear in style but I could still be chillin in sweat pants and a stainless ring
Without you I havnt gained a thing oh

Uh, What up y'all? Yeah
Soundtrakk, what's popping baby?
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week, he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
Uh, uh, uh

[Break: Drake]
What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check

[Verse 2: Drake]
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, ""You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'""
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, ""Auntie, this is a safe career""
She said, ""Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here""
[Hook: Drake]
So I kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick Then push
And coast

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, yeah
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said ""There's no skating here""
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh, uh

Tell Me Lies,rap,drake,2007,19435,"""Tell Me Lies"" - Scene 1

[Verse 1: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
You say it's simple, it's who you ought to be
Look in the mirror, you are not what you see
You say it's simple, but aren't your wings tired?
To tell the truth, why do you have to hide?

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies

[Bridge: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
What's wrong with being someone else?
No shame, and living life their way, tell me lies

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
They like, ""Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined.""
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
It's like
[Hook: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now

""Tell Me Lies"" - Scene 2

[Verse: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, ""Please, please tell us your reality, J!

My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so

[Hook: Drake as Jimmy Brooks, (Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin)]
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now

Tell me anything but the truth

Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business
It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, it’s just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin’
I know I got a couple things that Lil’ Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Don’t let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I can’t let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhol’s for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson of something

Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged
Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch

I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)",en,"are you familiar with this feeling no concealing its out all out in the open the type of life you first timers could soak in that virgin pussy's waiting and im about to poke it im underrated , i am ricky henderson to oakland but im about to sleep em , acquire em' , and keep em' i require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a dust pan new guy , too fly , who buy seven cars dubai seven stars you die heaven's our's and you don't see the jag drop in here its like im chasing my dad the way i tag pops in in here lets see how many carrots we can do mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue who are you ? you confused homie , that's a pensive look there where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear thats a 07 but i got a even newer ride doors all suicide i should be your tour guide im expedia flown wikepidia known obtain a key to your home and take a seat on your throne i been through it all spend it all to do it all you are not me man i could never be you at all cause you just stupid dog the a8 super large and yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged aight check , flow switch , flow switch i don't ever pay a percentage of the retail only thing im paying is attention to the detail schedule can change at the mention of a email booking up a show with some tension with a female my dad said to get rich you have to dig deep cause drake these some big streets and you are not big meech and you are not rayful and this is not dc four years later quarter million off of tv you was having hoop dreams i was drafting group schemes take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams well woop there it is oops now my troops clean first car audi drop , color like a poutine im feelin grown up , don't ask me for id , like you know who i be , bouncer i know the owner i never go , i felt out of place at a school dance cause they know the layout of the mall like i knew france inside and out , therefore i been hiding out and you drive cars that i been riding out correction i been rode em out been showin' out , sold off shit the stories you've been told about and dog , i been old amount young money old accounts degrassi my royalties homie you just owed an once no weight move my shoulder counts man , i don't even know my name anymore man","['familiar', 'feeling', 'concealing', 'open', 'type', 'life', 'timers', 'soak', 'virgin', 'pussy', 'waiting', 'm', 'poke', 'm', 'underrated', 'ricky', 'henderson', 'oakland', 'm', 'sleep', 'em', 'acquire', 'em', 'em', 'require', 'retainer', 'retire', 'sweep', 'em', 'dust', 'pan', 'new', 'guy', 'fly', 'buy', 'seven', 'cars', 'dubai', 'seven', 'stars', 'die', 'heaven', 'jag', 'drop', 'like', 'm', 'chasing', 'dad', 'way', 'tag', 'pops', 'lets', 'carrots', 'mixin', 'farm', 'land', 'green', 'paratrooper', 'blue', 'confused', 'homie', 'pensive', 'look', 'dark', 'oak', 'floors', 'expensive', 'cookwear', 's', 'got', 'newer', 'ride', 'doors', 'suicide', 'tour', 'guide', 'm', 'expedia', 'flown', 'wikepidia', 'known', 'obtain', 'key', 'home', 'seat', 'throne', 'spend', 'man', 'cause', 'stupid', 'dog', 'super', 'large', 'yea', 'got', 'range', 'shit', 'ai', 'supercharged', 'aight', 'check', 'flow', 'switch', 'flow', 'switch', 'pay', 'percentage', 'retail', 'thing', 'm', 'paying', 'attention', 'detail', 'schedule', 'change', 'mention', 'email', 'booking', 'tension', 'female', 'dad', 'said', 'rich', 'dig', 'deep', 'cause', 'drake', 'big', 'streets', 'big', 'meech', 'rayful', 'dc', 'years', 'later', 'quarter', 'million', 'tv', 'having', 'hoop', 'dreams', 'drafting', 'group', 'schemes', 'bus', 'kids', 'turn', 'coupe', 'teams', 'woop', 'oops', 'troops', 'clean', 'car', 'audi', 'drop', 'color', 'like', 'poutine', 'm', 'feelin', 'grown', 'ask', 'd', 'like', 'know', 'bouncer', 'know', 'owner', 'felt', 'place', 'school', 'dance', 'cause', 'know', 'layout', 'mall', 'like', 'knew', 'france', 'inside', 'hiding', 'drive', 'cars', 'riding', 'correction', 'rode', 'em', 'showin', 'sold', 'shit', 'stories', 'told', 'dog', 'old', 'young', 'money', 'old', 'accounts', 'degrassi', 'royalties', 'homie', 'owed', 'weight', 'shoulder', 'counts', 'man', 'know', 'anymore', 'man']",7,Emotional Connections

About the things that we would fix
How the fuck we got this rich?
This is just some inspiration
For young niggas on they shit!
This for my young niggas on they shit for real
This also for the hood stars that I created
Whose booking rate went up right after we dated
Girl you made it for real
Hosting parties with athletes or another rapper
Then they trying to fuck you after
Remember when you was my....bitch!?

You remember how you got here?
Hope to God you ain't forget
But the look you're giving me tells me you did
Empty stares across the club

I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year""
Even if you never met me you can tell I’m on the same shit
Loyal as a mother fucker nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I should have went to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women they can be so
Motivated by money that’s why they be on me for
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
If he is the one I’m the zero, (pshh damn)
Please comprehend I am a Surf Club general
I’m Mr. consistent I have never come in intervals
You don’t want be caught in the middle like a center fold
I'm committing suicide if we're ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now?
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me I'mma be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
They see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground dont fuck with my swingset
We get the pitching then that's when it gets to piling

Between Us,rap,drake,2009,10200,"[Verse 1: Drake]

Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me

[Hook: Drake & Slakah The Beatchild]
I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
You'r now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die

Uh, yeah man, uh
I feel real good right about now
I feel like im, im making a return
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man

[Verse]

Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?, carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow, wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home
[Outro]
Uh, and thats just what it is
Uh, everybody that mess with me I see you
You feel me
Benard I see ya homie
Precise I see ya
Ransom, brandon I see ya
Uh, niko I see ya uh
Yea richie sosa I see ya uh

Where Were You,rap,drake,2012,186966,"[Verse 1: Drake]
I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can’t believe we’re finished
My life is movin’ fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can’t put this behind me
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could’ve had my all by now, by now
It’s been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you
[Verse 2: Dawn Richard & Drake]
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keeps looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question

[Chorus: Colin Munroe & Drake]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (Uh)

[Verse 3: Drake]
I can't go to bed
I'm thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We we're on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out
[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)

Brand New Remix,rap,drake,2008,16431,"(Drake)
This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new

(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(Aye Aye Aye)

(Drake verse 2)
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?
(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new girl
(Aye Aye Aye)

(Lil Wayne)
This here on some remix shit
Seems like ever thing I do they leakin it
And I hate hearing stories of who im sleeping with
I swear I got to hide what I got in my ride
So she still think im confident and damn
How long will this last
My life is on the pedestal, am I moving to fast?
Feel like im in crazy competition with my past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything im doing brand new

(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(aye,aye,aye)

(Lil Wayne)
Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
Dont blame me if any man would if he knew better(um huh)and dont won't to here about him anymore
But I know you heared this song before..
(Drake)
Is anything I'm doing brand new(6x)
Is everything I'm doing too late(6x)

Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed
On the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?

(chorus w/Drake)
Is anything im doing brand new?
Brand new brand new
Show me if this is brand new, new
Ooh ohh yeah yeah yeah

Im Ready For You Full Length,rap,drake,2012,5627,"[Drake: Verse 1]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over. Baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya!
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for her, you sayin' no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

(Background voice)
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya
I'm in control, but with you bein' a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
So keep thinkin' you the man
Cause it's all part of my plan
I-I-I'm ready for ya
Nothin' on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental picture, no cameras please
(Background voice)
[Drake - Verse 2]
Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
Flash, black lingerie white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast
Define fast, cause I can speed it up, and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
Still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got bagges, well im packed too, plus I got a sex pistol
Pointed right at you ""BANG!"", the baddest women ever in the heart of south
Proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt, plus im
Young money 'till the death, I took the carter route
Im more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about

Ho, I hope this ego trip you on won't last honey

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, ""Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
'Cause we—

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame
'Cause we—

The Grind,rap,drake,2007,13373,"[Intro: Nickelus F]
Out tryna to get this paper

[Chorus: Nickelus F]
We in hoodies and timbs
Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
I'm out tryna to get his paper

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
I wake up, got money on mind
And I can't get off so I got to get on my grind
Got to get all my ducks in line
My bills in order crackers taking orders
For niggas in the race I got water
For niggas with hate I got llamas
Tissues for they mama
I'm flyer than Aladdin on a carpet
Saw A Whole New World when I made my profits
And my jasmine is a rapping
I do it the best, These niggas ain't smashing
Raw dog action
I impregenate the beat everytime I speak
A seed of my speech concives and MC! (Ho!)
Similar to me( yes),so we ain't' got to write just think
Keep it in the head like T
Spit listerine on the beat
Flossin' diamonds and me
Now peep the way I deliver on the beat
Is what you lack yeah that's why I'm so SWEET!
That's why yo chick want to pump me (right)
She want to be the chick from the other guy
Wanna be a lover I chuckle I laugh
As soon as you turn yo back I'm smashing
Hey I'm the other guy
Now you wanna rumble why
I mixed some limbs up make you a jambalaya
Wet you up
Roll you down the mountain and let your tumble drop
Throwback line for those who been listening (Uh!)
For all the new listeners that boy just filling
Niceklus is gifted nickename his Christmas
Make up a wishlish
Cop yall CD at this point I bet yall get it
At this point forget it..
I'm like a preganat woman I deliver
Now pop it push it!
[Chorus: Nickelus F]
We in hoodies and timbs
Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
I'm out tryna to get his paper

[Verse 2: Drake]
(I gotta spill on this)
That's why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms won't extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exactly who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
It's Drake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I don't lie to rhymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If there's a wall I'm gon' try to climb-aaa
Without a graded rope
Our navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me
I'm always gon find another way to go
I'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou, I sell verses to label
And they give me the next joint
To sound less like you
That's something I had to say before
I'm real picky with real with lyrics
So don't use joints you probably would pay me for
I ain't' a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the street's Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song
I'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen
Now she want the Snackpack back and her pudding's missin'
Bring the topic back
Please don't stop the track
Tropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal
Tryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammar is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
There's a certain female rapper I will expose and
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didn't pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that
Anybody else get the piece that I bend back
Let it marinate if you niggas dare to hate",en,"out tryna to get this paper  we in hoodies and timbs out on the grind rain or shine nickels and dimes i'm out tryna to get his paper  i wake up , got

5 AM in Toronto,rap,drake,2013,1486962,"[Intro]
Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

[Verse]
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?
[Outro]
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah",en,"yeah this on some old tommy campos dice raw shit , you know ? for my niggas , though  uh , you underestimated greatly most number ones ever , how long did it really take me ?

Girls Love Beyoncé,rap,drake,2013,2256692,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy, James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name

Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name

Do What You Do,rap,drake,2006,15483,"[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her
[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2]
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy
[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all

Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Bridge]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself
[Chorus: Drake]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Successful Remix,rap,drake,2009,4199,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Part of me wished I can meet with
All you haters in person, they got a lot of
Feelings for me they just ain't certain. How to
Express themselves when I walk into the club and
Take stares like the fuckin elevators ain workin
Yeah. Cause they know the promoter pays you, you wouldn't
Have come if somebody hadn't of made you, you just looking
Forward to seeing women that played you and shitting
On the men they get engaged to, I swear it's like. Uh
More confidence and less fear. We can discuss it further
When y'all manage to get here. Diddy here, O here
Skinny here, Rex here and we just having one of them conversations
About next year. I`ma kill it, I promise that`s how I know you
Mad. I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads. The
Big homie use a flash if you must and I swear I ain't asking
For much, all I want is the

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Hip-hop is like school, yeah I had to
Learn it. Beef is like a blank disc, yeah
I had to burn it. They finally showing me
Respect but I had to earn it. I'm heading to
The finishing line, ain't got no time for
U-turns. Today I realise that I'm not perfect
Everything I did to get here wasn't really worth it
Why won't they just let me be great. You fall down seven
Times you stand up eight. Realise true happiness lies
Inside of you. Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo
The birds singing after the motherfukin` storm gone. If you
Want to sing, you can always sing this song. Turn my swag
On, this my theme song, there`s 95 per-cent chance that I used to
Be your ringtone. I got swissel and cheese but I don't yodel
Heart tatted on my neck they love my vocal

[Hook: Trey Songz]

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
As I sit back and spit this crack and leaking
On the internet and watch my haters react
50 said they can't read between the lines so
I jab, uppercut, punchline after punchline
I know you thinking damn Soulja going hard
Right now. And I'm thinking damn this is just the
Start right now. Soulja Boy is going on a renegade
If life give you lemons make lemonade
[Hook: Trey Songz]

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future. That`s real shit. Beezy

The Motion,rap,drake,2013,1696275,"[Intro: Drake & Sampha]
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion

26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Interlude: Dennis Graham]
But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang...
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…
[Verse 2: Drake]
Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)
[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be?
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********
Hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?

All Me,rap,drake,2013,4005603,"[Produced by KeY Wane]

[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)
[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn!
[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...
[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man

About the Game,rap,drake,2006,11109,"[Intro: Drake]
Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck (No)
Ain't about the ice on my watch (No)
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game (It's about the game)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch (No)
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game (Bout the game, uh)

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game
[Bridge: Trey Songz]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

Normally Drake sip Don P but
You the type of girl that I need Patron with
We could do it, corporate sponsor
Your man prolly riding in his boy's Elantra
You could drop him, he's forgotten, you got options
And plus I show these young boys how to bring the money on in
When they rhymes ain't hot, and they records don't sell
Stuntin' on the strip, came with no I.D
And I only brought cash, if they checkin' oh well
I'm good, Drake make one phone call and I'm inside
Welcome to the life of an icon
And I don't like jewels, but I am thinkin' of you
In the mirror while I'm puttin' all this ice on
So

For you to back it up, go on and put ya weight on it

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me
Baby, it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours

How you feel about
Comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fuckin' out of spite 'cause your man don't
Do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good, then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas
Who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life, and this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
[Chorus]
I, I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me, baby
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's

You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? (Yours)
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend, I want it all to be for you, oh
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh

Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
'Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (Trippin')
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry"" (How you do?)
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga, it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
'Cause you got the Batphone and my work line
You should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days, but oh (Yeah)

Worst—
Motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'—nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause, man, it's a mission
Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?

On my worst behavior, no?

Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done growed up

Who's hot, who not?
Tell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you, bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior
[Outro]
Remember?
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Worst behavior

Furthest Thing,rap,drake,2013,2650003,"[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin', girl, and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to

""There's three balls and a strike
Here's the pitch
It's belted deep to center
Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!""

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, isn't it amazing
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication?
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with, ""This time will be different""
Oh, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

[Chorus: Drake]
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking
I'll be here, just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', babe
Yeah, swanging
[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
She just wanna run around the city
And make memories that she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power (Yeah)
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in a eighteen-wheeler
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She used to say, ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

[Chorus: Drake]
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here, just swanging (Ayy)
Don't talk to me like I'm famous (Ayy)
And don't assume 'cause I don't respect assumptions, bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
I'll be here, just swanging (Ayy, ayy)
[Verse 3: Drake]
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 East
And exit at Markham Road in the East End
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired, I renew it after the weekend
Fuck, I know I said that shit the last seven weekends
Girl, I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
'Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin', know you could feel it
Twenty on pump, whatever, I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours""
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there, just swangin'
I'll be there, just swangin'

From Time,rap,drake,2013,3799321,"[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

The Language,rap,drake,2013,2321210,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin' but your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it
[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, ""Girl, that's all that we do""
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, ""Girl, that's all that we do""

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny
You don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl
She been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city
And that's word to Stunna, you know it
[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, ""Girl, that's all that we do""
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, ""Girl, that's all that we do""

Come Thru,rap,drake,2013,1598633,"[Intro]
Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
[Verse 2]
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like

They don't work hard as you
Damn, that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count
Numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money
Girl, you just did it
I get it, I get it
Man, fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar
Your roommate got credit
Twelve months on the lease
That's a come-up, baby, don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy
Every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds
You sparkle, but fuck, man, the spark ain't enough for you

Tonight was your night
Go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it
I get it, I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall
That's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story
I get it, you did it, you did it
Got a link on the champagne
Your best friend is bartending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes
Let 'em know that you run shit
I get it, I get it
I'm working too hard, let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city
Heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI?
I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, ""Girl, get your paperwork right""
I get it, I get it
What's up for the night?

Too Much,rap,drake,2013,2144551,"[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one hundred
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin'
'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath
You're too worried about being the best out""
[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess""
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
That's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together
We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down
Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
But we've been down
[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Oh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, oh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh
(Don't do that—)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
'Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well, if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire

Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2,rap,drake,2013,3551921,"[Part 1: Pound Cake]

[Spoken Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Chorus: Timbaland]

Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach, but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said, ""Hov, it ain't many of us""
I told 'em, ""Less is more, nigga, it's plenty of us""

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
Five hundred million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uh
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah, we got it, bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel
[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2]

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg

Tuscan Leather,rap,drake,2013,1578112,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Alright, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Comin' off the last record
I'm gettin' twenty million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga, that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga
Rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
Yeah, I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self-explanatory, you just here to spread the story
Wassup?
[Verse 2: Drake]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money, nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission, tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3: Drake]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these nineties fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like ""Fuck it"", like ""YOLO""
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me
Now real nigga, wassup?
Ayy, yeah, ayy
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
[Spoken Outro: Curtis Mayfield]
If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoyin' yourselves?
If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

Trophies,rap,drake,2013,1432697,"[Verse 1]
Yeah
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a ""fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug"" song
This a ""fuck-them-boys-forever, hold-a-grudge"" song
""Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub"" song
Nigga, ""just-because"" song
Damn
[Chorus]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

[Verse 2]
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, ""I heard all your niggas stay where you stay""
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song

Heat of the Moment,rap,drake,2014,408547,"[Verse 1]
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

[Chorus]
She asked me
""Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?""
She asked me
""Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?""
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
[Interlude]
What are we even doing?

[Verse 2]
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, ""You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him""
And I say ""Well, goddamn""

[Chorus]
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

All of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.

We Made It Freestyle,rap,drake,2013,623350,"[Intro 1: Eastbound & Down (Kenny Powers)]
The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days

Soulja Boy, Drake
Oh, we made it
Turn me up just a little bit in the headphones
Worldwide, international

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, she said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007, I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like ""Nigga we made it!"" (Go off)
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin' (Go off)
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'ma just hand her a business card and say ""Nigga we made it!""
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like ""Girl he got some good dick and money""
Her friend hit her back like ""I know that already, that nigga's amazin'""
Then I send a message to both of they asses like ""Nigga we made it!""
[Interlude: Kenny Powers]
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

Ayy, we made it

Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, if they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, there's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up, watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like ""Nigga we made it!""
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it (Go off)
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience (Go off)
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say ""Nigga we made it!""
I swear that we made it, selloff that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell ya, I don't need no favors (Go off)
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like ""Nigga we made it!""
[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
I remember standing in the hood
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, two times I crashed
Ha, nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say ""Nigga we made it!""
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I don't need no favors, ayy
Nigga we made it!

[Verse 3]
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, ""When that shit is real, you just know""
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, ""I feel you, nigga, I already know""
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, ""You gotta leave already?""
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said ""You're mine"" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley four-door already
Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah

Draft Day,rap,drake,2014,1008128,"[Produced by The Fam; co-produced by Boi-1da]

[Intro]
(Watch out, watch out)
(Look out, look out)
(Watch out, watch out)
Yeah
(Look out, look out)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later, how am I the man still?
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side, bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, ""Pay the guys""
Man, I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to—
[Verse]
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, ""Okay, if you say so""
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
SZN
[Chorus]

Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could

I Promise, I try College
Did it but I quit it they couldn't define knowledge
For me, I got it, So I’m honest
He living, Spitting Wisdom with some of the top artists
Who are not flawless, but my part is
Yet they don't see what I'm doing is not (?)
They like, Promise, why bother
Well living in the sewer, it’s filled up with hot garbage

Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me
[Verse 2: Drake]
If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take a L
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It’s hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all thickle but a ways it could sound
Full of loud and go and put her face to the town

When I said I’m not a rapper it's not cause I am
It’s cause my momma said I'm not like them
I don't look like them
I don't act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin’
And I am the truth I can't lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
But watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like agua
We don't like no fake, nada
Rappin' ass actor,you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think Promise featured a pop star?

We Made It Remix,rap,drake,2014,1861,"[Intro: Trae]

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm the man in my city like biggie, so haters they probably can't stand him
Should've been part of the opera the way that I play in the Phantom
This bird on my seat kind of bright for me, fuck it I told them to tan em'
First rapping nigga that powered the streets so the radio banned him
I'm looking for something to surf on the night with a body so vicious
If she not fucking I tell her get lost and I send her the worst of my wishes
I'm helping my niggas get dinner we eating, they talking bout dishes
Fuck with my money I'm pricing your head, blow the rest on these bitches
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Try to keep that on the low, cause them people find out we gon' probably get raided
Find me a tutor, head game was smart to the point I was searching for knowledge
She just got her masters, something amazing you would think she fresh out of college
Shout out to Drizzy and OVO, and this shit I just got from Tokyo
That alley hoop helped me, I'm finna' score
Gotta let my nuts hang on before we go
I'm patiently waiting, swang is patiently skating
Just incase they ain't hear what I stated, I ain't worried
My niggas we made it
[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it
Nigga we made it, aye
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it

[Verse 2: Drake]
She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like ""Nigga we made it!""
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'm a just hand her a business card and say, ""Nigga we made it!""
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like ""Girl he got some good dick and money""
Her friend hit her back like ""I know that already, that nigga's amazin'""

A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45

Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you

And you'll always be less

You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, where Jen and Melissa
(Say Hi, M)
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives

Believe it or not,rap,drake,2014,1198,"(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)
I'm so fucking dumb, I wrote diamonds on my thumb
I got a diamond on my dick, so thats a diamond on her tongue
I can't feel you baby, cause I'm romanticly numb
Emotionally drained, I came here just so i could cum
Theres nothing under Gods sun, that I haven't done
I got a lot of problems, gettin pussy just isn't one
Girls are like buses, every fifteen minutes they run
Now their like potato chips, I just can not have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I dont like yo friends in my business
And I feel like you deserve a Benzy
Cause you wasn't in the kitchen with me, water whippin


[Chorus: Drake]
Uh uhh uhhhhh, I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talkin boo but we just don't believe you
[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, okay I'm all about it, all for it
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward
I'm never puttin up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitations, so I'm shooting if I draw for it
Pow pow, Fuck is up, now I'm up in this hoe
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all this minutes go
Mixtape dropped, then I started gettin ten a show
Now I get a hundred, what the fuck you think I'm in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, J, and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend they time attackin me
Shoutout to you're girlfriend nigga, lately she been distractin me
Wondering if im the best, well I ain't no blaceyedpeace
Girls wanna fuck and niggas gotta wanna be you
Line'n up around the block, so they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just dont believe you

That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)

How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?
[Interlude]
My heart belongs to you...

[Verse 2]
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then

Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there ain't a Shawn Carter now, feel me
Get with it, I'm trying to overthrow a nation using fade to black as a nigga's only motivation
I'm picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent is proven
A show of hands who's in?
And if you must know, this year I'm going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am  have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me
I'm a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto
So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mimosas with the clicquot

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy
[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)

It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)

[Intro]
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

[Verse 1]
I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They don't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

Why do I feel like you owe me one?

You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now

They can't live this long

Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine

I had to get back to you, woah

[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure (Man, man)
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 1]
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in
[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 2]
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go
[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure

6PM in New York,rap,drake,2015,1147956,"[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it
[Outro]
Yeah, gotta love it

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 1]
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, ""Where you movin'?"" I said, ""On to better things""

[Chorus]

Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
[Verse 2]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man

OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep

[Verse 3]
I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been
[Chorus]

I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well, run up when you see me, then, and we gon' see

I got enemies,  got a lot of enemies

They actin' like these singers, man
""I ain't— I ain't goin' to the studio 'till I got a situation

Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

[Verse 1]
Brand-new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, ""Where the check, though?""
Yeah, I said it
Wouldn't dap you with the left, ho, shut the fuck up
Text from a centerfold, I ain't reply, let her know I read it though
Voicemail say she ready though (Yeah)
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'Cedes Benz pedal
Doin' ninety on the bridge, like, ""Nigga, you already know""
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four, five chains, man, the gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, ""The first mill' gon' change you""
Change for the better, hit it, then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work, ayy

Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass

Been a minute since we've slept together
Finna get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s yacht, that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae
[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny

Still in Miami, most of these girls are too messy

I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah
PND ain't with the ray-tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here, going way, way, way, way, way, way—
Sauga-city trip, the payday
Glo'd up off a Gateway, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing; doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in they feelings these days, all in they feelings these days
But hearing a scripture with that many 6's, you should be afraid

[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who""
I told her, ""girl, I'm always back with you know who,"" yeah
And she like, ""Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice
[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price

Madonna Physical CD Version,rap,drake,2015,11503,"[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 1]
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in
[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 2]
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go
[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up

Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take you down through there
Make me wanna take you down through there

Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man

Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

[Chorus 2]
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get

You know what I think we could be some day

If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change

Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley

How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby",en,"this shit was all i knew you and me only i did it all for you still you were lonely we coulda worked it out , uh , but i guess things change it's funny how someone else's success brings pain when you no longer involved , that person has it all and you just stuck standing there but , i'm gonna need you to say something baby say something baby , say something baby , say something baby i'm gon' need you to say something baby i'm gon' need you to say something baby yeah , it really sucks , but ever since i've been long gone i traded in my senorita for a microphone i hate the way we fell apart , girl , it's sad to see your life was good , but me and you , we a catastrophe if i was a success , oh , would you be satisfied ?

Fallen,pop,drake,2009,7658,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, it's Drake, KC

[Verse 1: Keshia Chanté]
We was just walking
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
Got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After I leaned in I helplessly fell in

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love
[Verse 2: Keshia Chanté]
In love and I can't see
What's happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what pain and tears taught
See my hearts been broken before
It don't trust love anymore
One kiss from you
I just felt myself fall right through

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 3: Keshia Chanté]
Got me hypnotized with your magic spell
I got butterflies, can't control myself
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you
It's true, don't know what to do

[Bridge: Keshia Chanté & Drake]
Don't stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You showed me how to love again
And there's no reason why
I can't give you a try (you know what it is)
'Cause it feels so right
[Verse 4: Drake]
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin' I'm a liar for?
Airing laundry, that's what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Tellin' you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
Callin' them out is red rover to me
To them it's a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh

[Alternate Verse: Drake]
I'm going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet T's girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
Thats why I love you

One more motherfucking note
It's like this... Look at him
I ain't been here in a minute)
Cut the lights off I feel fantastic right now baby...
Yeah... Look...

[First Verse: Drake]
I said I used to cut the porch lights on and now I cut the porches lights on just to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper going with that obscure ice on he a lame I'm just tryna get my mature life on
O.D., O.D. Everybody know me, even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C
Oh me Oh my them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip get a glass pour the XO in
I did want one these niggas to say that I'm not the same
Pick a road cause where you driving is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C life is not a game
Taking over the world no Pinky just a lot of Brain
He bout to send them the shit that I'm on (Yeah)
You probably could have predicted I'm on (Yeah)
My sense of judgment's a officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisher is blown
Ahh... I'm grown, I'm grown, I'm living in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high, I'm never coming down and you say you got them hoes but they never coming 'round
I got penthouse bars I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (Bitches)
But money's over (Her)
Cause money's under (Nothing)
My life is such a (Blur)
That's not the way it has to go that's just what I prefer
And do not disagree with me it's best you just concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I fucking die they're going to bury me alive...
[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm living good gripping wood with all the features
Jesus my money straight no creases
Peep this

Bitches over there... we good (O. D. O. D.)

Feel like I swallowed a whole bottle of Vicodin... (Dam)
So high I wanna cry like tiny violins
In my best mode the pesmote enjoy the silence... (Shh)
Stop the violence, how when every blind is like the motherfucking Watts riots pouring out my pen
Alright then be easy I'm a get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics but I can't leave the crib without some Xanax in my water... (Nope)
Hello my name is Travie and I'm a lifeaholic
Told'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromitt... (Ha)
The alpha to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
Worn without the other so for real without the candy brain
Super trooper like a gun tote in candyman
Ask me how I'm living bet I tell ya fine and dandy man
Check his vital signs they peaking off the meter man
Imma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pulling the nine out
Imma pull a Amy Winehouse
Sipping Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house... (My House)
Isaiah I'm a see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity it's Travie, Uno, Easy

And this name of it is fame and it's all up in my blood
Trying to suppress the too fresh feeling I got... Oooh yes

Every other night I need a brunette for group sex
Leaving with a bruised neck then I yell whose next... (Next)
Stand'em in a line this is new fact city take this crack between ya thighs... (Yeah)

Got me like a stoner, a zoner but nah it's never over... (Mickey what you mean)

Hung out with celebrities from every drug house

Get Like Me,pop,drake,2009,4163,"Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote
Money is everythang, and its every other thing
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang
Cash is the right now, women are the post game
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain
It's comin too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin
It's on meee, everything is on meee
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness.. Drizzy!
Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order
Whatever ya'll please.. wine crackers and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my t's
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese
My watch make the frickin' time freeze
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money.. bitch...
Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right?

Drake Talking/ad-libing:
Its Young Money Baby
I got something for these niggas to ride to
Fa'sho
Here I go

(Verse 1)
Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the bangers
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)
And i say, i be on some G shit
I be on some G shit
Check out what i done, and
Check out who i be with
Im me bitch, i said i'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

---Guitar Break---
(Verse 2)
Bust that pussy open, then i tell her bring it back
Make sure you dont fall in love
Cuz i dont have the time for that
Only thing i chase is money, if you tell me where its at

When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say i be on some G shit, i be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, i said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

---Guitar Break/Breakdown/Solo---

(Outro Verse)

I Do This,rap,drake,2009,3637,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, shit's all good
The deal got signed, and my split's all good
And these haters pretending that it's all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish y'all would
I'm a motherfuckin' genius, goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname's ""Starter Drake""
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like
[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie (Drake)
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

[Verse 2: Belly]
Here I go, street reaper
Ballin' over here, we need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house looks something like a resort
You can't resist bein' rich when you record
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
If your life is a movie, you a extra
I'm so fly, I glide: Clyde Drexler (wooh)
Mister pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now, fuck next up

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it

Big timer on the loose
Got a bitch riding five
And everytime I pull up you know I'm iced up
When I step up in the club I light the bitch up
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint rally stripe shining like us
Pearly white maybach, hatchback automatic straps stash spots under the rack
Bitch, ready to spray that
Foreign grinds hard times
Getting mines, you know up town
Big time doing time
You know, Harley Davis baby
Cash money is pay me so you pay me how it weigh
Baby, black, gold
100 mill off the floor
Never told now you know how it go bitch
One hundred, one hundred
[Drake:]
Yeah
Your now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And balck on black 62 float majestic
Me and stunna in it, boy I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
It's about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank me later first week I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shortie, go ahead buss it open
I keep a secret baby, nothings heard when nothings spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Are confused all the conversations between y'all
And dog that's funny, pay me what you know nigga

Throw It in the Bag Remix,pop,drake,2009,11666,"She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (You know we had to go shopping one more time right, I think we forgot something haha)
All we do is shop until we drop
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups (Uh uh uh uh uh)
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (Uh uh)
All we do is shop until we drop (I said if you get money, if you get money)
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)

Just throw it in the bag
It's Mr.Throw it in the bag
I just throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it costs but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I didn't know it had a tag
I'm no liar I don't front I'm a buy her what she wants
Cause the queen supposed to get what she desire what she wants
If my lady likes to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this cream, she the fire to my blunt
You can try it if you want but it's gon cost you
Bags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine

Uhh Ahhh
We up in Barneys going dumb again
Everytime we leave the manager say, ""come again""
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my momma's friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If the card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money coming in
Yeah, just fold some paper round the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband until she found out he cheats
Then she filed for divorce and watched that bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
He son that's 26 but he just went to away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's a baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaazy
And I be spending all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah, she say that she lucky that she his
No, I m lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isss
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes

Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean looking right
And you can't put a price on something looking right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's looking like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm booking flights
If I want it I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And it's on everything I got a crazy lady
So money ain't a thing, Jay-z, JD
Like Jay-Z lady, it's Beyonceing
Supporting your woman goes beyond paying
Watching me ball is like LeBron playing
I'm in the Louie shoes you might see Kanye in
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine

Invented Sex,pop,drake,2015,5628,"This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all goin' home with Trigga?

I see you at the club, ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty
Then I said, ""Baby, wassup?""
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug

Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me

Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gonna end up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex

Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway
Said she like the way I touch her, listenin' to usher
(Yup)
I got a confession
(What?)
Know we 'bout to sin, but your body is a blessing
(Father, forgive me)

Girl, can we take it up stairs
(Up, up, up stairs)
My bed's waitin' there
(Waitin' there, yeah)

All I want to do is
(All I wanna do)
Is give you all of me
Won't you give me all of you?
I want your body like right now
(Right now)
You know I live a magnum lifestyle
(Lifestyle)
Baby, turn the lights down
And I'mma turn you on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

Girl, when I pull back them sheets
(Take the covers off)
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
'Cause I do it like I did
You gonna think I invented sex

It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out

Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it

Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed

Yeah, can I, baby? Can I, baby?

[Verse: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
[Outro: Drake & Beyoncé]

Charged Up,rap,drake,2015,1508356,"[Intro]
Stop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

[Verse 1]
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

[Verse 2]
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up
[Verse 3]
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me, this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road, I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!

[Outro]
(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
Have you seen me? I’m doing so good
Every time we meet: ""Oh, I’m so sorry""
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)

[Sample]
""You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak.""",en,"stop , stop , stop… fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas that’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up i’m so sorry did you hope i was crying ? it was rough without you it was rough without you  i did some charity today for the kids but i'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases all y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation i stay silent 'cause we at war and i’m very patient six god is watchin' , i just hope you’re prepared to face him i’m charged up , i’m charged up  wow , i’m honored that you think this is staged i’m flattered , man , in fact , i’m amazed the perfect start to the summer , man , this shit is a doozy this shit a twist in the movie , but don't jump to conclusions you boys are gettin' into your feelings on me you should embrace it , this could be one of our realest moments okay , the flow start to feel familiar , don’t it ? must i remind you that jimmy got 20 million on it ? need dj clue to drop a bomb on it none of them want this shit more than i want it i seen it all comin' , knew they would push a button east egg huntin' , they gotta look for somethin' done doin' favors for people 'cause it ain’t like i need the money i make off a feature i see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows but so it go come live all your dreams out at ovo we gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes i get a ring and i bring it home like i’m cory joe no woman ever had me star-struck or was able to tell me to get my bars up i’m charged up oh no , we eatin' , niggas ain’t about to starve us nah , niggas ain't about to starve us i'm charged up  i bought my niggas rollies off of thank me later while these boys was stanky leggin' trust me , this information is vital i’m tryin' to take the high road , i still got love for my idols i got me a deal with apple and i still feel entitled rumor has it , there’s somethin' that only i know rumor has it , i steer the ship with my eyes closed rumor has it , i either fucked her or never could but rumor has it , hasn’t done you niggas any good it’s sound , sound , sound ‘til the day i die we goin' live to keep this shit alive cops are killin' people with they arms up and your main focus is tryna harm us ? and you think you ‘bout to starve us ? niggas ain’t about to starve us nah , i’m charged up !   have you seen me ? i’m doing so good every time we meet: ""oh , i’m so sorry""   ""you know , i kept it real it ain’t too many real people out here and people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long industry people… regular people… and then when you keep it real with people , they cross the line , take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak .

Hotline Bling,pop,drake,2015,6877777,"[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like, ""Oh well""
You're like, ""Fuck it, oh well""

Okay, I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
'Cause you don't trust me like your last man

Buy the things you can't afford for ya?
'Cause he must have did a lot for ya

And now your past is behind you like the car with the strap in it

I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's no need to stash right (Money)
Same four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me

[Verse 1]
Hey yo I'm movin' on up, excuse a moi, pardon it's me
There's a new chapter to life that I'm starting to see
And I'ma make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I can't lie, there's certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live there's nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, who's faith in his team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelet's clean
I'm stayin' the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
I'm a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you don't like it you should ban rubber

These days I really can't break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, don't call me broke cause I strictly  resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket I'm in's is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin' me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga 'bout it when it's in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till I'm piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I don't understand less is more
Wanna get 'em to the point where they owe me, and they gon' see Drake's on his JOB, it's like...

Back to Back,rap,drake,2015,4970613,"[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
[Chorus]
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back

Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like, ""Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”

[Hook: Drake]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feelin' like Rae, same damn 'Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, Moetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothin' like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Bruh Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, ""It's yours""
I know this shit is mine for the takin'
If I ain't in Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this
[Hook: Drake]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours

It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge: Drake]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
[Hook: Drake]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten

Empire,rap,drake,2016,21338,"[Intro: Rick Ross]
I'ma tell you like this, nigga

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I got a hundred Gs on my line
I ain't eatin' Jacksons when I be in Overtown
Bitch I'm eatin' lavish, look up, ho, it's snowin' now
I just throw the cabbage, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League gon' hold it down
Got a odor there in the attic, that's a couple pounds
New Rolex that I ordered, that's a hundred thou'
Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
My nigga GDK a goon, he'll gun you down
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they ain't pat him down
I got a hundred niggas on my line
A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
[Verse 2: Drake]
Alright my patience runnin' thin
Olympic pools of money, I'm just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope your diving board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold, my niggas do not desert me
Nah, but shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And these haters pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person, man I wish y'all would
I say you lucky if your father was a figure
Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin' bigger
I took time to load the bullets, now I'm 'bout to pull the trigger
Like boom, boom, boom, I'm a genius, god dammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Yeah, nd to my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname Starter-Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other lames is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like

[Intro: Drake]
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking
Looking
Looking

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…
[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Beat switch]

[Verse 2: Drake]
All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here?
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six, soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…
[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen

You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him

Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know

Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy, y'all get so offended, ayy

Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish, but I

Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Chorus: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby, I like your style

[Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time, and that's why

[Chorus: Drake]
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go

Where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control

Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum (They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl, let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
[Verse 2]
They still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot be me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like 101
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, ayy
Momma doesn't have to call work now, ayy
I decide when I start work now, ayy
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist

You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?

Keep the Family Close,rap,drake,2016,1324358,"[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Chorus]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end
[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that
[Chorus]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro: Girl (Spoken)]
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

U With Me?,rap,drake,2016,1933146,"[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'
[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me
[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit",en,"what these bitches want from a nigga ?  on some dmx shit i group dm my exes i tell 'em they belong to me , that goes on for forever and i think we just get closer when we not together you tell me that i'm confusin' more immature than marques houston cuts too deep for a band-aid solution we too deep in this thing , you'll never lose me lolol , i'm glad you find this shit amusin' heard a lot about me 'fore we started off i know you heard that my pool parties like mardi gras i know you heard that my girl is sponsored by audemars that's why she always correctin' me when my time is off and my house is the definition of alcohol and weed addiction you got a different vision you wanna walk around naked in the kitchen without runnin' into one of my niggas that's not the way we livin' too much goin' on , it's just not realistic these days i don't talk 'bout them days like i miss 'em and you shouldn't miss 'em either , we different people but every time we speakin'  it's like a lot of games bein' played how's it goin' down ? if it's on 'til we gone , then i gots to know now is you wit' me or what ? yeah it's like a lot of games are bein' played how's it goin' down ? if it's on 'til we gone , then i gots to know now is you wit' me or what ? yeah  i wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs where you're getting me all that grey in our conversation history , you playin' mind games , when you sayin' things playin' mime games , we both doin' the same thing slide on a late night you like to slide on a late night you sent a ""are you here ?

Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you, yea

Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose

Hype,rap,drake,2016,912032,"[Intro: Baka & Drake]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see RiRi right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again

Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah

Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But y'all don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Heard the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
That they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah
Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
We done really put some days in
[Interlude: Future]
Hey, why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn

[Verse 2: Future]
Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 1]
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog

Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 2]
Oh, and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it, then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the door's open, and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog

Too Good Demo,rap,drake,2016,3344,"[Refrain 1: Rihanna]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

[Refrain 2: Drake]
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you

And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you

You take my love for granted

Hype Remix,rap,drake,2016,23380,"[Intro: Baka]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I pull up on you in that purple thing
Bumpin' Purple Rain
Singin' ""Purple Rain,"" sippin' purple rain
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
It's a different world, it's D'wayne Wayne, oh Lord
Okay now we got some action
Fucking models out of Maxim
I'm too wavy, I'm what's happening
Okay now we got some rapids
Orange bottle full of tablets
Okay now we got some habits
Smokin' cookies, sippin' Acti
Okay now we got some balance
You see my team is right next to me
You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank her for takin' my breath from me
But the second me gon' be the better me
J.R. Smith with the shot
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
I call my AK Barney and I'ma let this baby pop
Pull up on you like Steph Curry
With my foot up on you like eff worries
Been outchea since Keith Murray
Codeine got me with pink urine
So you know I don't have the energy
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes
And I don't have the sympathy
[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype

We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since ""No Scrubs"" and ""No Pigeons""
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
""Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike""
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, ""You did that""
They even hit my line like, ""Where you been at?""
It's always on some shit like
""When can I get a favor?"" or, ""Where my bitch at?""
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, ""Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?""
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind
[Outro]
Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh

Summer Sixteen Live Remix,rap,drake,2016,1808,"[Hook: Drake]
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try to say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those the strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

[Verse 2: Drake]
All you boys doing fake ""Controlla""'s wanna be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave you the whole money play and y'all still broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me (they know me)
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed (I done changed)
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game (game)
This ain't no motherfucking '91
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
(in this shit but Bun)

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?
[Hook: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Verse 2: Drake]
You hit me like “I know you’re there with someone else""
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax (straight straight to the)
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me
And you can’t take no L’s off me
I know you been...

Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?

You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
[Verse 3: dvsn]
How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I got to know you again
You want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone
Gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again
Over and over again
You tell me I should know you
But I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
When were in the zone you
Gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over
You're coming over
[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4: dvsn]
I wet all the floors of your ego
Feel like I was slipping away
And you know that I ain't gonna go, ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere
Cause some of these things never change, no, no
I know that you know, that you know, you know that's it's true
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I matter with you
But we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do

Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
And until you do babe (don't you leave)
Ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Tonight I'll make sure (you cum before me)
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
But before you do (don't you leave)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Make that sure you (cum before me)

Get you on top of me
We can do this still properly
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back
You're like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me
Yeah, you don't want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me
Unless you're down to do this publicly
You know, you know you gon' get comfortable
On the [?] rug with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that ""I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions""
Let's see what's next then
And it makes so much sense now (I need you to cum)
Girl it makes so much sense now (told you to leave)
You know that I'm gon' make sure now (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure  (cum before me)
Make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)

Two Birds One Stone,rap,drake,2016,1006388,"[Intro]
Yeah, more, yeah

[Verse]
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a ""not guilty""
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, ""This what we need to be on,"" but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
""I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.""
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy

We got London on da Track

[Verse 1: Drake]
This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga (Yeah)

[Refrain: Drake]
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh
[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position (Yah)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (21)
Make me call my bro (21, uh)

Baby, I'm a savage, I ain't romantic
When I come around, these rapper niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (Hatin' now)
She was playin' with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (Mansion)
I was fightin' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (Blastin')
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss (Nope)
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch (Broke)
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit (21)
They the type to stand in line for some free shit (Broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (Suck it up)
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block (Fuckin' up)
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' (21)
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones (We the ones)
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come (21, 21)
You that nigga snitchin' on your people, huh? (Shh)
21 Savage a.k.a. The Reaper, huh (21)
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh (Ya dig?)
[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (Shut the fuck up)
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end (Count the fuck up)
Make me call my bros for assistance (21)

Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (Hol' up)
Put me in a fucked-up position (21)
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, dawg

I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'ma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1"", man, a nigga need some leg room

[Refrain: Drake]
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh
[Chorus: Drake]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position

Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is greaze (Greaze!)
I'm in the penthouse but still, nothin' is sweet (Yeah)
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth

I've got bitches in the merky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spen jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy (Oof!)
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky (Jerky)
Whippin' that white girl (Yeah?), cookin' that Cersei (Dah!)
I was pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal (Yeah)
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo (Mmm!)
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole (That arsehole)
Man are gettin' bread now, and this is that hard dough (Yeah)

Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit
[Chorus: Drake]
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, ""Poor me""
Where you at? I never see you

Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It’s bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me, ""Pay it no mind""
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die

Drake  DJ Semtex Interview,rap,drake,2017,1503,"[DJ Semtex]
When we hooked up years ago, you were supposed to come on the show, it didn’t happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in Hyde Park. I said it felt like you’re gonna make history

[Drake]
It’s been a while, that’s kinda how we ended up here. When I got here [London], I was just like in my room, just tryna find my lineage of coming to London and just trying to figure out where it all started. And I just watched that Hyde Park interview and I’m watching this kid, it’s me but to me it’s just a kid that’s just trying to talk, trying to answer questions in the best way possible. Just the fact that we were just walking around, just me, you, a microphone and a camera. I was like “man I should hit Semtex up, man we should talk again”. I feel like that was a good conversation, we covered a wide spectrum of things and I think it’s been a long time since somebody’s been able to sit down and do that with me, and that’s how we’re here

[DJ Semtex]
How’s it feel to go from doing mixtapes, So Far Gone was the mixtape that really broke, before that Lil Wayne mentioned you in an interview with me, and I started following you and it’s just grown. From there you’ve been non-stop, its crazy…

[Drake]
Yeah that was an amazing time for all of us… still doing it with the same people. It was just… our landmark for that project is 15 Fort York, which was “40” and Oliver’s apartment and we really started that project there. Then it moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA, when we were first just getting around Wayne, I know Wayne mentioned me in the interview, but the real turning point for me was when Wayne went on stage at the MTV awards and rapped one of the verses from ‘Money To Blow’. Instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses. And at that time, people are like, people from back home who really didn’t….. I mean it was just a tough thing to believe like, “I know he says he’s over there but is he gonna come home with a Lil Wayne record, is this gonna really happen” at that time people were like “ok he just rapped Drakes song, if he gets a Wayne record this is outta here”
That was when I was able to come back off those trips with Ransom. I went back home with Ransom, which was the first time I had ever got a Lil Wayne verse. From there I had a bunch of songs that I had recorded at the studio called Hot Beats and Wayne just got on all of them like ‘Stunt Hard’ and ‘Forever’ was one of them, early early. Then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again I still work with to this day and my music wouldn’t be what it is without them, that’s Oliver and ‘40’ – you know it’s funny cos we’re sitting here talking and they’re back in Toronto executive producing ‘More Life’. Oliver’s executive producing it and ‘40’ is obviously always involved, but kinda just a full circle moment for us, cos Oliver had so much input on ‘So Far Gone’ so I was like “man it would be nice to do something with me and you again”, so I gave him that task and he’s at home piecing it together. So yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that I guess we’ll talk about

[DJ Semtex]
A lot to talk about – ‘More Talk’…
Since we’re right at the beginning, I was in Amsterdam with Lil Wayne….and he tells me – Yo he’s been writing on ‘Detox’ that was like the mythical album, you gotta be about your business to be involved in that, or to be in the studio. How did you end up from doing a tv show to working with Dr Dre, writing for him on Detox? It’s taking it back…

[Drake]
Its taking it back, I’m not usually that good with the ‘taking it back moments’ but I actually remember this one vividly. But yeah, I was on the show and while I was on the show, I started getting less and less character time, because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that I was more focused on music. And at the time I actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for Degrassi, so I ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where I would leave work, go home get my stuff – Degrassi was all the way in the east end, which is Scarborough that’s like an area of our city. I’d go home all the way back to the city, get my stuff, come back to the studio, I would record and around 4/5am I would sneak back into Degrassi, they’d let me in and I would go to sleep in my dressing room. Eventually they found out what I was doing and they got really upset. During that time I was crafting all these songs, and I had a song that Omen produced – it was me and Mickey Factz and somebody else was on it I think. So Dre had heard the song and he had hit me like, “man I need proof that you wrote this” (laughs), so I had to fax him the lyrics of the song, I had to send him a fax message, from my moms fax machine in her bedroom I sent him a fax

You know at that time, Detox was going on, it was more like he had just a camp of people, I guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something. I was flown out to record at Record One, which is a legendary studio. Yeah I was in there for a while, I did a lot of work, me and ‘40’, always brought ‘40’ with me, that was like a stipulation in my career, I wouldn’t move without ‘40’, so brought ’40’. Got to meet a lot of great people, obviously got to work with Dre, and it kinda all came to an end, when I.. Dre brought me into his office and said “Man you’re doing really good work” and he gave me a $10,000 cheque, and it was the most money I’d ever had in my life and at the time I was in a relationship. So I got the money and I called my girl, and I flew my girl down to L.A and was like “we can get a hotel this is crazy”, it was just a joyous moment for me. And I had missed studio or I had done something wrong, I had let my mind deviate from work and I had missed something, and next thing I know I was sent home and that was kind of it. It was a huge life lesson for me and I still have that… Actually when Dre came out at the Forum, I brought him the $10,000 cheque cos I had saved the actual hard copy of it, even though I got the money for it, they let me keep a copy of the cheque
So yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on, and I had heard rumblings, like oh all these people are here and I had met Snoop, and I kinda wrote this song, that ‘40’ still has somewhere for Dre and Snoop. We listened to it not to long, couple years ago, its kinda hard. But yeah it was a great experience, a great learning experience for me and ‘40’, it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and I think that set us on our own path
[DJ Semtex]
So lets fast forward to 2015/2016, VIEWS one of the most successful albums, the tour you did in America was the most successful tours. How do you feel about what you achieved with VIEWS and the reaction? It’s a very pivotal point for you, going from writing for Dre and being on a TV show all the way up to …

[Drake]
Yeah I mean, it was one of those moments in my career, where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build, it can either result in massive failure or massive success. Obviously somebody’s watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that I felt I was ready to take at that moment. And yeah, I mean I was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover, to just the styles of music that I felt we introduced almost as a package. It kinda started with ‘Work’ because ‘Work’ came out before my album, and then progressed into ‘One Dance’, ‘Controlla’, ‘Too Good’. But just the style of music that was making me happy at the time, because to be completely honest with you I was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time I was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that I’d come off of. I was having trouble trying to make rap music where I was able to peel back the layers and every time I’d make a song – ’40’ is always really bluntly honest with me and was like “Man you really sound like aggressive and defensive” – and I was just trying to figure out why and I realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that

So there was a time where I actually thought about taking the rap off of VIEWS and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why I’m here, I know who my core fanbase is, and so towards the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best as I could, on the rap end. You know I still listen to the bars and I know exactly where I was at and they are great to me, and they are time markers to me, but yeah, I guess we’ll get into ‘More Life’ after and how that situation progressed. But yeah VIEWS for us was, it was surreal, the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve, it was an incredible time for us. And of course in true OVO fashion we didn’t celebrate it all, we just kinda went on to working on the next thing. That was kinda it, it was just another album to us, it wasn’t my biggest album by any means, it wasn’t the one to me, it was just another chapter in the story but I’m very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it. Whether people want to admit or not, the influence that it’s had on music, I feel is very evident, whether people don’t wanna say it

[DJ Semtex]
Did you know what you were doing when you made ‘One Dance’, Kyla’s on there, Wizkid is on there, it’s a truly global records, because I think very few people have done what you’ve done with mixing everything with the US, the UK and African sounds. Did you know how big it was going to be, it was the song of the year

[Drake]
It really all started with the Kyla record, it was just a song that I had played, we Dj at our own parties just because …

[DJ Semtex]
How did you discover it though, that’s like a UK underground Funky Sound…

[Drake]
I mean I just listen to a lot of music and I have friends with great taste in music, so I’ve been personally putting that song in my own playlist and DJ set for like four/five years now, I know it’s older than that, even just playing it and having people… What really set something off for me was having people in America come up to me and be like “Yo what was that song you just played?” and I would be like “man people really like that song but they don’t know it”. So I just, my brain started working of like how could I utilise a bit of it, there’s so many good pieces. So I introduced the concept to ‘85’ and I said to him like “man if we could make a beat, I don’t wanna do a cover I wanna write a whole new song, I just want Kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse, or as a bridge to the next hook”, and he was like “alright alright cool”

I had the beat for a while, I was just trying to figure it all out, and at that time I had met Wizkid through Skepta, cos we did a remix of one of Wizkid’s songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally. And when it was all said and done, it was one of those moments much like ‘Hotline Bling’, I just didn’t really know how people were gonna feel about it, and that was part of the reason why I dropped ‘Pop Style’ along with it, cos I was kinda almost nervous like man I don’t know, this is just so different, let me just make sure I drop a rap record, so people just know I’m still on my shit. And I remember Boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard ‘One Dance’ and he just looked at me and he’s like “man that’s gonna be the biggest song of your career to date” and I was like “c’mon man it’s like, that’s a lot to say, we hope it does well”. And yeah he was right, and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things, so many thank you’s to Kyla for being so supportive, she came out to South Africa and shot a movie with us for this song, and you know of course Wizkid doing his thing, and yeah just the entire UK for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it

I love that tempo, I love that cadence, those melodies, that’s the music that makes me happy in life, so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the UK that deserves it, because that’s truly a classic song

[DJ Semtex]
With ‘Pop style’ what happened with that, because when I got it originally it was Jay-Z and Kanye on it and they kinda weren’t on it?
[Drake]
Yeah, I was dealing directly with Ye and that’s the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like “man you know this is like ‘Pop Style’ featuring the throne, this is huge” and I was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up. And then I didn’t know what I was gonna hear. So when I heard Jay had two bars, I was like alright it is what it is, it’s cool I like that, it’s a little intro and Kanye goes off. And then you know I’m not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time, or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was, I’m not really sure but next thing I knew it just became a bit of an issue. And you know from there I don’t waste too much time, so I just was like alright cool I’ll finish it, I can rap as good as anybody else, so I’ll just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos I don’t really like… you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business, I don’t play that. So it just needed to be done and I did it myself and yeah both versions exist, so when Kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy. I know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know…

[DJ Semtex]
On the Pablo tour, he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said, before the last show, he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music. Is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening?

[Drake]
I don’t know, I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being… like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I’m not really sure, everybody’s got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if that’s what it is I don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through, I accept it, I don’t respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night. And yeah I accept what you’re going through, and I just go and continue working on my own thing. You know the more and more this progresses, the more and more I just feel like keeping to myself, cos its just so unpredictable, you never know which way people are gonna go. I mean streaming is the new record business, so yeah I guess you could call it digital politics, that’s kinda a good name for a song, I might have to do that when I get upstairs

[DJ Semtex]
So with ‘Childs Play’ another banger, there’s a line on there where you say why you acting light? What does that mean?

[Drake]
Oh you mean “I’m acting like I’m light skin”, that line (laughs), that’s just sorta something people… that’s like very an American thing people say like ‘ah man’ you’re being light-skinned”, I guess they say it’s like ‘emotional’ you know. I just think it’s a ridiculous stereotype, but I was just kinda playing on the irony of it, cos I’m actually light skinned so it made me laugh so I said it. But yeah it’s just a silly stereotype in black American culture, that light-skinned guys are this way or that way, so that was just a little joke

[DJ Semtex]
When did you first experience racism, you’re coming from a dual heritage, your fathers black, your mothers white, it puts you in a predicament, when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides, or one side or the other?

[Drake]
Man you know, I’ve really been grateful in my life to be born in Canada and just the journey that I had growing up was so… it was just a very accepting journey. I always had friends from all different backgrounds, from different walks of life, we all get along, I never really notice colour, religion, we don’t live like that. There’s really not that much segregation in Canada, and especially in Toronto, it’s like a cultural mosaic. And I know I’ve said that time and time again, but it truly is, it’s made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you don’t ever develop hate. You know, the first time I really experienced it, was when I got famous and went to America and people would challenge me, like I don’t understand how it works or like “your Canadian, you’ll never understand, like the Black American struggle, or you’ll never under…..” That was the first time I really got challenged, and it was by people I had met from America that were like even close to me at the time

You know, if I ever feel anything or if I ever feel like an outsider, it’s usually because I’m not American to be honest with you, that’s when I feel like people are against me or they feel like I’m not part of the…. I guess it’s got something to do with the fact that I have quite an eclectic make up, I am mixed, I am Jewish. Yeah but I feel like, at the end of the day when it comes to everything else I’m Black. I am referred to as a Black artist, last night at that Awards show, I’m a Black artist. I’m apparently a ‘rapper’ even though ‘Hotline Bling’ is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is a ‘rap’ category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past, or because I’m Black, I can’t figure out why. Just like I can’t figure out why ‘One Dance’ wasn’t nominated, maybe because they can’t… I mean, well it’s just there’s pop obligations that they have and I fluked out, I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and I’m proud of that, you know. I love the rap world, I love the rap community, but you’re right I write pop songs for a reason, I wanna be like Michael Jackson, I wanna be like artists that I looked up to, those are pop songs but I never get any credit to that

And shout out… and by the way I’m speaking to you as a winner from last night, I won two awards last night, but I don’t even want them, cos it feels weird for some reason, it doesn’t feel right to me. I feel almost like alienated or you’re tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos it’s the only place you can figure out where to put me. And remember they don’t decide the winners, but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically. And shout out to Chance, for last night, like I said I’m speaking from a winners point of view and I’m so happy for him, I’m not talking about.. I’m not angry about how last night worked out. But when you ask me like where, like do I feel, like racism, or do I feel it the same as everyone else, yeah I feel it, I notice it going on in it’s own places. But thankfully I get to be around the greatest group of people, my friends are from all over the place, they like Lebenese, they’re.. I’m Jewish, most of my friends are from the Islands of Jamaica, English, so I mean, we just don’t really notice it like that until I start talking about the music business

Yeah it’s a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and I think we know it’s a tough time and I’m …
[DJ Semtex]
How did it feel to be on stage in Manchester when the Grammy’s were going on, you stuck to the tour..

[Drake]
Yeah I mean I did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me that’s real life you know. I was pitched by the Grammy’s to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they don’t air the other rap awards on TV. So I would have left 30,000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know. The worst part is I expressed myself, like man I’m really thankful I was at those shows in Manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that we’ve had so far. I texted somebody from the Grammys and was like I’m really glad I stayed behind, I really don’t wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and I got a text back that said ‘Blame It On Donald Trump’ – and I’m not gonna say who it is that I’m texting but this is like the institution, we’ve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments, for our music. By the way if you had a night like Chance last night, he deserves it, for his friends, for his family, for his collaborators, its amazing when they champion you. But all I’m saying is, to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment, that’s OK too. Because you have to realise what institution you’re dealing with. You’re dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and they’re either good people to the core or bad people to the core and we’ll never know. But I mean yeah, I was really glad that I was in Manchester last night, and like I said I’m speaking from the perspective of a winner, I won two awards, it’s just it really put it all in perspective for that thank God that I stayed here and did what I’m supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music, you know. Yeah man, that’s just kinda how I feel about that about this given time",en,"when we hooked up years ago , you were supposed to come on the show , it didn’t happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in hyde park . i said it felt like you’re gonna make history  it’s been a while , that’s kinda how we ended up here . when i got here  , i was just like in my room , just tryna find my lineage of coming to london and just trying to figure out where it all started . and i just watched that hyde park interview and i’m watching this kid , it’s me but to me it’s just a kid that’s just trying to talk , trying to answer questions in the best way possible . just the fact that we were just walking around , just me , you , a microphone and a camera . i was like “man i should hit semtex up , man we should talk again” . i feel like that was a good conversation , we covered a wide spectrum of things and i think it’s been a long time since somebody’s been able to sit down and do that with me , and that’s how we’re here  how’s it feel to go from doing mixtapes , so far gone was the mixtape that really broke , before that lil wayne mentioned you in an interview with me , and i started following you and it’s just grown . from there you’ve been non-stop , its crazy…  yeah that was an amazing time for all of us… still doing it with the same people . it was just… our landmark for that project is 15 fort york , which was “40” and oliver’s apartment and we really started that project there . then it moved to the beverly hills hotel in la , when we were first just getting around wayne , i know wayne mentioned me in the interview , but the real turning point for me was when wayne went on stage at the mtv awards and rapped one of the verses from ‘money to blow’ . instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses . and at that time , people are like , people from back home who really didn’t… . . i mean it was just a tough thing to believe like , “i know he says he’s over there but is he gonna come home with a lil wayne record , is this gonna really happen” at that time people were like “ok he just rapped drakes song , if he gets a wayne record this is outta here” that was when i was able to come back off those trips with ransom . i went back home with ransom , which was the first time i had ever got a lil wayne verse . from there i had a bunch of songs that i had recorded at the studio called hot beats and wayne just got on all of them like ‘stunt hard’ and ‘forever’ was one of them , early early . then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again i still work with to this day and my music wouldn’t be what it is without them , that’s oliver and ‘40’ – you know it’s funny cos we’re sitting here talking and they’re back in toronto executive producing ‘more life’ . oliver’s executive producing it and ‘40’ is obviously always involved , but kinda just a full circle moment for us , cos oliver had so much input on ‘so far gone’ so i was like “man it would be nice to do something with me and you again” , so i gave him that task and he’s at home piecing it together . so yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that i guess we’ll talk about  a lot to talk about – ‘more talk’… since we’re right at the beginning , i was in amsterdam with lil wayne… . and he tells me – yo he’s been writing on ‘detox’ that was like the mythical album , you gotta be about your business to be involved in that , or to be in the studio . how did you end up from doing a tv show to working with dr dre , writing for him on detox ? it’s taking it back…  its taking it back , i’m not usually that good with the ‘taking it back moments’ but i actually remember this one vividly . but yeah , i was on the show and while i was on the show , i started getting less and less character time , because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that i was more focused on music . and at the time i actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for degrassi , so i ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where i would leave work , go home get my stuff – degrassi was all the way in the east end , which is scarborough that’s like an area of our city . i’d go home all the way back to the city , get my stuff , come back to the studio , i would record and around 4/5am i would sneak back into degrassi , they’d let me in and i would go to sleep in my dressing room . eventually they found out what i was doing and they got really upset . during that time i was crafting all these songs , and i had a song that omen produced – it was me and mickey factz and somebody else was on it i think . so dre had heard the song and he had hit me like , “man i need proof that you wrote this”  , so i had to fax him the lyrics of the song , i had to send him a fax message , from my moms fax machine in her bedroom i sent him a fax you know at that time , detox was going on , it was more like he had just a camp of people , i guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something . i was flown out to record at record one , which is a legendary studio . yeah i was in there for a while , i did a lot of work , me and ‘40’ , always brought ‘40’ with me , that was like a stipulation in my career , i wouldn’t move without ‘40’ , so brought ’40’ . got to meet a lot of great people , obviously got to work with dre , and it kinda all came to an end , when i . . dre brought me into his office and said “man you’re doing really good work” and he gave me a $10 , 000 cheque , and it was the most money i’d ever had in my life and at the time i was in a relationship . so i got the money and i called my girl , and i flew my girl down to l . a and was like “we can get a hotel this is crazy” , it was just a joyous moment for me . and i had missed studio or i had done something wrong , i had let my mind deviate from work and i had missed something , and next thing i know i was sent home and that was kind of it . it was a huge life lesson for me and i still have that… actually when dre came out at the forum , i brought him the $10 , 000 cheque cos i had saved the actual hard copy of it , even though i got the money for it , they let me keep a copy of the cheque so yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on , and i had heard rumblings , like oh all these people are here and i had met snoop , and i kinda wrote this song , that ‘40’ still has somewhere for dre and snoop . we listened to it not to long , couple years ago , its kinda hard . but yeah it was a great experience , a great learning experience for me and ‘40’ , it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and i think that set us on our own path  so lets fast forward to 2015/2016 , views one of the most successful albums , the tour you did in america was the most successful tours . how do you feel about what you achieved with views and the reaction ? it’s a very pivotal point for you , going from writing for dre and being on a tv show all the way up to …  yeah i mean , it was one of those moments in my career , where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build , it can either result in massive failure or massive success . obviously somebody’s watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that i felt i was ready to take at that moment . and yeah , i mean i was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover , to just the styles of music that i felt we introduced almost as a package . it kinda started with ‘work’ because ‘work’ came out before my album , and then progressed into ‘one dance’ , ‘controlla’ , ‘too good’ . but just the style of music that was making me happy at the time , because to be completely honest with you i was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time i was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that i’d come off of . i was having trouble trying to make rap music where i was able to peel back the layers and every time i’d make a song – ’40’ is always really bluntly honest with me and was like “man you really sound like aggressive and defensive” – and i was just trying to figure out why and i realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that so there was a time where i actually thought about taking the rap off of views and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody . but obviously i know why i’m here , i know who my core fanbase is , and so towards the end of the album , i tried to execute it as best as i could , on the rap end . you know i still listen to the bars and i know exactly where i was at and they are great to me , and they are time markers to me , but yeah , i guess we’ll get into ‘more life’ after and how that situation progressed . but yeah views for us was , it was surreal , the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve , it was an incredible time for us . and of course in true ovo fashion we didn’t celebrate it all , we just kinda went on to working on the next thing . that was kinda it , it was just another album to us , it wasn’t my biggest album by any means , it wasn’t the one to me , it was just another chapter in the story but i’m very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it . whether people want to admit or not , the influence that it’s had on music , i feel is very evident , whether people don’t wanna say it  did you know what you were doing when you made ‘one dance’ , kyla’s on there , wizkid is on there , it’s a truly global records , because i think very few people have done what you’ve done with mixing everything with the us , the uk and african sounds . did you know how big it was going to be , it was the song of the year  it really all started with the kyla record , it was just a song that i had played , we dj at our own parties just because …  how did you discover it though , that’s like a uk underground funky sound…  i mean i just listen to a lot of music and i have friends with great taste in music , so i’ve been personally putting that song in my own playlist and dj set for like four/five years now , i know it’s older than that , even just playing it and having people… what really set something off for me was having people in america come up to me and be like “yo what was that song you just played ? ” and i would be like “man people really like that song but they don’t know it” . so i just , my brain started working of like how could i utilise a bit of it , there’s so many good pieces . so i introduced the concept to ‘85’ and i said to him like “man if we could make a beat , i don’t wanna do a cover i wanna write a whole new song , i just want kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse , or as a bridge to the next hook” , and he was like “alright alright cool” i had the beat for a while , i was just trying to figure it all out , and at that time i had met wizkid through skepta , cos we did a remix of one of wizkid’s songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally . and when it was all said and done , it was one of those moments much like ‘hotline bling’ , i just didn’t really know how people were gonna feel about it , and that was part of the reason why i dropped ‘pop style’ along with it , cos i was kinda almost nervous like man i don’t know , this is just so different , let me just make sure i drop a rap record , so people just know i’m still on my shit . and i remember boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard ‘one dance’ and he just looked at me and he’s like “man that’s gonna be the biggest song of your career to date” and i was like “c’mon man it’s like , that’s a lot to say , we hope it does well” . and yeah he was right , and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things , so many thank you’s to kyla for being so supportive , she came out to south africa and shot a movie with us for this song , and you know of course wizkid doing his thing , and yeah just the entire uk for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it i love that tempo , i love that cadence , those melodies , that’s the music that makes me happy in life , so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the uk that deserves it , because that’s truly a classic song  with ‘pop style’ what happened with that , because when i got it originally it was jay-z and kanye on it and they kinda weren’t on it ?  yeah , i was dealing directly with ye and that’s the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like “man you know this is like ‘pop style’ featuring the throne , this is huge” and i was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up . and then i didn’t know what i was gonna hear . so when i heard jay had two bars , i was like alright it is what it is , it’s cool i like that , it’s a little intro and kanye goes off . and then you know i’m not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time , or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was , i’m not really sure but next thing i knew it just became a bit of an issue . and you know from there i don’t waste too much time , so i just was like alright cool i’ll finish it , i can rap as good as anybody else , so i’ll just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos i don’t really like… you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business , i don’t play that . so it just needed to be done and i did it myself and yeah both versions exist , so when kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy . i know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know…  on the pablo tour , he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said , before the last show , he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music . is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening ?  i don’t know , i think everybody has their own little things going on , i’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time , cos in the same breath , i went from being… like working on a project with him , to him sorta publicly shitting on me and dj khaled for being on the radio too much . but yeah i’m not really sure , everybody’s got their own thing going on . again me when i hear that , i just distance myself from it you know , alright if that’s what it is i don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through , i accept it , i don’t respect it at all . you know cos i feel like me and khaled are just good people , i’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night . and yeah i accept what you’re going through , and i just go and continue working on my own thing . you know the more and more this progresses , the more and more i just feel like keeping to myself , cos its just so unpredictable , you never know which way people are gonna go . i mean streaming is the new record business , so yeah i guess you could call it digital politics , that’s kinda a good name for a song , i might have to do that when i get upstairs  so with ‘childs play’ another banger , there’s a line on there where you say why you acting light ? what does that mean ?  oh you mean “i’m acting like i’m light skin” , that line  , that’s just sorta something people… that’s like very an american thing people say like ‘ah man’ you’re being light-skinned” , i guess they say it’s like ‘emotional’ you know

Right to Left,rap,drake,2009,1649,"[Intro]
[?]

[Chorus: Drake]
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together moving
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)

[Verse 1: Von Pea]
Yo, what i gotta do to get you pussy cat dogs
To not, act hard like I wouldn't jab y'all
You a trap-star, cool i'm a dream catcher
You from New York, stop biting off Atlanta
Pea is a rap terrorist, suicide bomber
I'ma blow up me and everybody around me
You can't show up pea im everywhere you try to be
Here's some advice get nice and don't lie to me
In my last 6 I trumped your whole shiznik
Son I've heard better MC'ing in limp bizkit
Rappers is rugrats, I am DR. Lipschitz
Come to ya shows theres enough space to park with
Wheres your fanbase, with so much damn grace
I plan your demise over eggs and pancakes
First thought of the day the second one goes
I won't stop until I see TM blow
[Verse 2: T.Dot]
[?]

[Verse 3: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus

[Chorus: Drake]
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
[Verse 4: Drake]
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise",en,"blue green jewels with the supreme fuel and looking raw up in the cut while i lay back cool and moving right to left , moving right to left moving right to left , moving right to left  wooden leather , base model never holding birds of a feather and we all are seen together moving moving right to left moving right to left , moving right to left   yo , what i gotta do to get you pussy cat dogs to not , act hard like i wouldn't jab y'all you a trap-star , cool i'm a dream catcher you from new york , stop biting off atlanta pea is a rap terrorist , suicide bomber i'ma blow up me and everybody around me you can't show up pea im everywhere you try to be here's some advice get nice and don't lie to me in my last 6 i trumped your whole shiznik son i've heard better mc'ing in limp bizkit rappers is rugrats , i am dr . lipschitz come to ya shows theres enough space to park with wheres your fanbase , with so much damn grace i plan your demise over eggs and pancakes first thought of the day the second one goes i won't stop until i see tm blow    how the fuck jay and dame gon' break up 'fore they meet drake ?

Get It Together,rap,drake,2017,619851,"[Verse 1: Jorja Smith]
Hello
I've been hurt so many times
It got to a point
When I decided
I can't do this anymore
I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me
I need someone that loves me

[Chorus: Drake w/ Jorja Smith]
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to
(Yeah, yeah)
You need me to

[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]
You know, we don't have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you're working late
When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but
[Chorus: Both, Drake]
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to (Yeah, yeah)
You need me to (Yeah)
You need me to

Nothings Into Somethings,rap,drake,2017,392545,"[Intro: DJ Paul]
You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me

[Chorus: Drake]
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?

Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now

Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won’t mention for now
’Cause we're fallin’ apart

Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say

Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun""
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already

Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind

No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah
[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you
[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Do Not Disturb,rap,drake,2017,1835832,"[Background: Snoh Aalegra]
Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary

Check my account, that's a madness (OVO, BBK, greaze!)
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish

[Verse 1: Skepta]
You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni (Shing!)
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud nine, a man's extra cozy (Bo!) (Greaze!)
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly (Bo!)
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy (Greaze!)
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade (Sex)
Red umbrella when I make it rain (Sex)
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same (Greaze!)
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans (Yeah)

Check my account, that's a madness (Street team)

Block that account, it's a catfish

Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision (Mmm)
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision (Straight)
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
(Greaze!) So don't forget to remember me (Yeah)
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see (Get me)
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me? (Bo-bo)
(Greaze!) Taliban, Halloween (Icy)
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline (Greaze!) (Bo-bo)
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine (Jeez!)
Bust my dance at the cash machine

Portland,rap,drake,2017,2043239,"[Intro: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, ""How is niggas really gettin' down?""
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now
[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

Never listen to the class rules (No)
Switch it up, they bit the last move (Let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches (Magnet)
You got the goin' out sad bitches (Sad)
I spent a fifty on the chain (Racks)
You spent your last fifty (Ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (Keys)
You got the key to defeat (Defeated)
I got the keys to the warzone (Brrapt)
You got the key to the peace (Ugh)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room (Yeah, in my room)
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: ""Let's go snorkelin'!"" (Yeah)
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs (Yeah)
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play (Kid N' Play)
God, the way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest (Straight up)
I guess for the fuck shit, I'm biased (Yeah)
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my mama out the basement (Mama)
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B up out the bracelets (Yeah, yeah)
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

Sacrifices,rap,drake,2017,1192681,"[Verse 1:  Drake]
Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, ""I know you need a break.""
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah
[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, ""Thanks for givin' to me,"" like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
""Pretty Girls Like Trap Music"" so I woke up with my wood hard
[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

I was stealin' from a bitch (Slime)
Back when I was 21 (Facts)
My favorite gun was a SIG (Nine)
20 in the clip, head one (No cockin')
Growin' up, I was a running back
You never made me ran once (Goddamn)
I got shot, sweat started runnin'
That shit was red like Hunt (Ketchup)
I'm kickin', pimpin' like I punt (Beat it)
But don't you think shit's sweet?
I'm talkin' sweet, deer meat (Ooh)
I'm talkin' suite like he sleep (Like he sleep)
We ain't doin' too much talkin' (Nah)

I'm talkin' neat like a geek (Yeah!)
You come with beef, I eat a B
I'm talkin' B’s, spellin' bee (Sheesh)
Double R, that's a Rolls
Paint it yellow like it's dairy
I'm talkin' Rose like Derrick
I'm talkin' rolls like a belly (Woo)
Like a new car, I got two keys
Tryna score the bucket like a Chevy seat (Chevy seat)
Then I heard they been pullin' all week (All week)
I'ma use your name like, ""Who is he?""
You get it? Haha!
I said I'ma use a name like, ""Who is he?""
Got some gold on, leprechaun, sheesh
Deep sleep short for deceased
Big bezel on the Patty (Woo)
I’m talkin' PADI—I meant Patek
Don't try to take it, I got guns
I'm talkin' guns, not pellets (Pellet)
I watch the game from the floor (Floor seats)
I'm talkin' wood, first mattress
I'm talkin' wood, pants down (Pants down)
I'm talkin' woods like them clowns (You get it?)
I got my mink off a monkey

Teenage Fever,pop,drake,2017,1824817,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
[Verse 2: Drake]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

Aww, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy, but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know; first, you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen, we with everything
I went off in the '16, give me '17

Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything, but I want everything

Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, ""Are we straight?""
Two-faced niggas back around with the three-face, damn

Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face

Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'

All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

Take Your Girl,rap,drake,2009,669,"[Hook 1: Lil Wayne]
Now shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Look, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl

[Hook 2: Drake]
And I can tell you, she wants me
She wants me, she wants me, she wants me
And yes I want her too
I'ma take your girl

[Verse 1: Drake]
I swear to you every time I sees her, I seizure
Keep running through my mind, jog my memories; amnesia
Touch ya, tease ya, nervous? Don't freeze up
She let me take control, I run a woman like a Visa
She always run back to me saying he's a dog
Off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her, ""Take a breather""
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches, but money's over her
'Cause money's under nothing, my life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it's just what I prefer
And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy, talk to 'em!
[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
And she wants me
She wants me yeah
And I want her too
Yeah, I want her too

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm talkin' 'bout shawty got something about her
Shawty got this thing about her
Shawty got that thing that make you wannna wrap a ring around her
Wanna rap and sing about her
So thats what I does, shit that's what it was
They rub my back in the tub it was me
Yeah, we all buddies
And shawty gots a husband, and everyone knows but him
But fuck him

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne]
And I can tell you, she wants me
She wants me, she wants me, she wants me
And yes I want her too
I'ma take your girl

[Hook 1: Drake]
Shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Listen, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl
[Bridge: Drake]
And her girls and they girls
Comin' with me yeah, talkin' one on three yeah
They ain't playin no D yeah
Thats cause they playin for me yeah

[Verse 3: Kid-Kid]
Just as long as we know whats good on both ends
I'm loving ya like I'm ya man though we just friends
If ya shy come see me for ya comfortin' I got a comfortable suite at the Comfort Inn
I tell her
I don't own a boat baby but I can float
And I don't own a plane but there's a mary jane and we can float
Your man ain't worrying about what's going on over here
You could get penalized the way you blowin' below the rear
Now this game like a analog I don't sweat cause it show how fake you are
She stressin', ya she testin' ya, she just tryin' to see what kinda level ya on
You don't make it bounce like a basketball, you ain't even get no ass at all
Now you sittin at the club trying to laugh it off, she done found her mid glam boy
You messin up, you messed up, wasn't easy to clean your Mess up
She found me and I blessed her, I applied to her pressure
She call me a professor, I went gave her her lecture
I bet she says I'm better, than her man was ever

[Hook 1: Drake]
Shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Look, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl

Forever Original,rap,drake,2009,3397,"[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shit, nigga, this what I does
I sware I ain't lyon, like this is my cubs
This is my tub, and I'm dirty in the summer, bitch
Weezy F Baby, and I lookin like I does some shit
You ain't know nothin bitch, you better know who you fuckin with
Try to fuck me, I kill you, and who you comin with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on the high heels, but I am no Boosie
Hollands Avenue, ridin; with the roof gone
On the Mayback, 2 tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's, boy, what you on
I'm richer than a bitch without the gray coupon
I'm talkin' out of my head, I make a blue eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a Blood, motherfucker, a Blood, motherfucker
Forever, like ETC period, motherfucker
[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm so unsigned, it would blow one's mind
Cause every single record I am so unkind
There is no holes bard, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know rugs cost
So PAY UP, I don't think you will ever find another nigga like me
Never LIE, I got everything I tell them I got
This young nigga show boat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Who else tryna' smoke, yeah nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the Pressure, that's what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a Ski-do
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down, hoe, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm going in, like a life sentence
And understand, I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that, 10 4
[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Kidd Kidd!
Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger, I can't deal with this shit, uh
You say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch, I'm back on my shit, like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly (ha)
Like Pooky, take a Dooky on a rap producer, loose leaf
Throw his trash ass out the window like Lukey
To a shark, you just sushi
You ain't hard, you coochie
Wally Oochie, soft as newborn booty
I say I'm movin slow, I'm just thinkin fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, about to lap your ass
And nigga, I don't rest, I'm up, till my times up
I be the tech chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't chorus lines, nigga, your choruses lyon
Cause the only point you ever gained, was a one
[Chorus: Drake]

Im Still Fly,rap,drake,2009,2324,"[Intro]
Yeah
Alright
Paige, I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind me, uhm havin' a little fun you know?
I know this your joint I just I always liked this song so I figured I may as well throw in
Here we go

[Chorus]
I'm still fly, (Yeah) I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings (Ah)
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand 'em (That's me singin' by the way)
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing (In case you didn't know)
I'm still fly, (Yeah) I'm sky high (It's some new shit, it's some new shit I'm on)
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings (I promise I got 'em though)
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around (Love)
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing (Here we go)
I'm still

[Verse]
Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre talent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permission to
Started poppin' bottles, cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there ain't an elevator in it, it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin', and these bitches wanna snow blow
And they just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ should've won that
Listen and respect, man, the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when you're done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch, just can't seem to hold it steady
'Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin' me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said it'd take a minute if you listening
Please start doing you, I been doing me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suin' me
My brother P-rain know, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot an officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
The names I mention are crucial, you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes, I could sacrifice a line
Yeah, I swear, I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin, no luggage
[Chorus]
I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand 'em
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I'm still fly, I'm sky high (Yeah)

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Yeah
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Check
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh
Are you listening? Is anybody listening?
Walk into the room and you can smell the Clive Christian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrilling bars, you'd think I'm writin' with John Grisham pen
I need rosé, never mind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom, no license
Fuck if you feelin' me as long as your wife is
No one in my city got a pocket like Drizzy
I could rock fitted jeans 'cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentals
And, Ms. Wrong, sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck y'all rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now, happy St. Paddy's
Yeah, I know you waitin' on the last quote
Check the SoundScan, you can see that I'm the last hope

[Chorus: M.I.A. & Drake]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Oh, I'm not done

Ye, what up?
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
I got 'em
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Uh
Look
[Verse 2: Drake]
By the way, I'm Jewish
And turnin' 22 gets depressin' when you see your favorite rappers goin' through it
Tryna reinvent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light-skinned youngin on some new shit
40, just record it and we'll drop this here
'Cause I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
You in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Yeah, fuck you really know about a Eames couch?
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake but a nigga livin' ya dreams out
Lookin' like a photoshoot every time the team's out
Yeah, and is the realest nigga still I?
A woman could love me to death but I still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and Wesson flow, you should tell them boys duck down

Yeah

You know what it is
No one on the corner has swagger like us

Cannonball Snippet,rap,drake,2009,824,"[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonball

[Verse: Drake]
Like my big bro say, I'm goin in
Olimpic loser money, I just glad I learned to swim
CAnnonball, bitch, I hope dive untill it's 30
And I hope when dinners cold, my fingers do not dessert me
And these haters like, damb m
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom
And yeah, I got a deal now, and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it
I'm the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray I'm running out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage
[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball

More Ready Remix,rap,drake,2017,6116,"[Intro: Drake & Trey Songz]
Yeah
I can't have the tissue before you sneeze, you know (No)
I can't bow down at your feet, you know (No)
Mmm
(No, no)
Yeah, Drizzy

[Verse 1: Drake]
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote ""Take Care"" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than—
Yeah, yeah
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Yeah
[Verse 2: Drake]
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite, yeah
I jump out of relationships before I get left in it, yeah
The sex we have reminds me of the money and success a bit, yeah
'Cause even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Big hotel suite, I'm the only one in it
Always going back to some shit that I already been it
Plenty fish up in the sea but I never go fishing
We got everybody sick, sending ""get well soons"" and a lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go

[Chorus: Drake]
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than—
Yeah, I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite
You try to make it right, I destroy what's left of it, oh woah
The sex we have reminds me of the money and sucess a bit
'Cause even since I got it, I don't wanna stop getting it
Even since I got it, I don't wanna stop getting it, yeah
Big hotel suite, I'm the only one in it (Only one in it), yeah
Always coming back when we're done, yeah, we're already finished, oh no (Yeah)
Plenty fish up in the sea and I love to go fishing
We got everybody sick, lot of ""get well soons,"" lot of well wishes (Oh)
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go

[Trey Songz]
I gotta keep you rigth here 'cause I don't like sharing
Yeah, She got a big [?] and I don't like carrying

Diplomatic Immunity,rap,drake,2018,1051996,"[Verse]
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
[Outro]
I love, I love
I love, I love it

All your hoes chose me, nigga, calm down (yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground – ain't no fist fight, bitch, I'm blastin'
Niggas say they lookin' for me like I'm not right here, man
If I tatted tears, I'd be cryin' to my beard, man
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.k.a. the man, a.k.a. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne
Only talk to bosses, not the second-in-command
Niggas bringin' talks to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name

[Chorus: Drake & Baka]
Yah, yah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.k.a it's Not Nice and it's not a fuckin' game
Gyah, gyah! You and I, we're not the same
Posted like Ibaka, got your wifey runnin' brains
She was there with boydem, kicked my front door off the frame
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Trap, trap, trappin' in the rain
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Just know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing

Might drive the Caddy around but I never lack
Baka not with the shit? So yeah, who tellin' you that?
I went to jail the day they released Men in Black
When I came out, Timberlake was bringin' Sexy Back
Facts, nigga! Facts!
I fell in love with my strap
Named my son Milli 'cause I want a milli' to stack
Gyah, gyah! Go run and tell that
You niggas move like the cops, don't make me pepper your block
Out the window while the whip's movin', that's a hell of a shot
Fuck all my opps, I'll put you niggas on FOX

Is There More,rap,drake,2018,521456,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas?""
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah
[Verse 2: Drake]
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay

[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, ""I'ma done him for you""
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you
Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you

Im Upset,rap,drake,2018,1921318,"[Intro]
Yeah
I'm working on dying

[Chorus]
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

[Verse 1]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool
[Chorus]
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check

[Verse 2]
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

[Refrain]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?
[Chorus]
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton

There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it

That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my 'Malis pop niggas

And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start

Free all of my niggas that they caught with it

This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I just flipped a switch (Flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop, ayy (Hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (Give me my respect)
I just took it left like I'm ambidex'
Bitch, I move through London with the Eurostep (Two)
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm gone (Outta there, I’m gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm an unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a gravedigger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again

Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went
(They don't love you no more)
You don’t wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8AM (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Whoa, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Whoa, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ah
You've got me fe–
You, oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada (True)

Haha, haha
Yeah, ayy (After dark)

[Chorus: Drake, Static Major & Both]
In the whip solo
No one's gotta know (After dark)
Knockin' at your door
I don't gotta work anymore (After dark)
You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (After dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 1: Drake & Static Major]
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (After dark)

Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (Ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, ""Fuck these niggas,"" rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, ""Do anything, but just don't lie to me""
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (Yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap

You probably wouldn't believe
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been

So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see
You liking someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me
Don't have me wastin' my time
[Chorus]
Yeah, you said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done

[Verse 2]
I kept it decent
I kept you sane, I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent
Even the secrets, kept it between you and I

[Bridge]
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea

UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down

'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down

[Verse 1: Drake]
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

[Verse]
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house
You live at, or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead, then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably could'a did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time, he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this, my G
[Outro]
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man

How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby

It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
It's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday
Yeah, who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anitta
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to–

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

They tried it, they went for it
All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on ya
It's your month and you know it (And you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, ""Play this shit,"" they better play it (Ayy, play it)
For you (For you), on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to–

Final Fantasy,rap,drake,2018,416645,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never really
Talk about dick that I wanna give you or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (Hi)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now

You were somebody I would stand behind

Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

Staying in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us

I just wanna load that and let that wet

Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts

Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories of how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'

If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Key West retirement plan
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah

One Man Show,rap,drake,2010,462,"[Verse 1]
Look, I ain't never had a benzo
Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo
Nosey niggas is peakin' in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over

Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show

[Chorus]
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
[Verse 2]
I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly

Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-L [As in Samuel Jackson]
I've been real though [?]
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a bridge game

[Chorus]
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know

Ayobi
Yeah yeah yeah
I see changes

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I (Changes)
[Bridge]
I see changes

[Verse 2]
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over (I see changes)
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh (I see changes)

Acapella,rap,drake,2006,876,"[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, I just got clean rap
I don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me
[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy
[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me

And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah",en,"look at my history i'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me the only thing i see is custom owls from tiffany and some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany really , that's it to me aside from the obvious , man , it changes in scenery testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery they say that they happy , my man , that's not how they seem to be the boy , he wild and peaceful , rest in peace teena marie ethics and values , mob traditions , old fashioned monopoly action bronny buyin' up brentwood like he still in akron a lot of pain , a lot of passion a lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin' that's how we continue down the path of jordan and jackson that's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin' last year , niggas really feel like they rode on me last year , niggas got hot 'cause they told on me i'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me i'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me yeah , loro piana and brioni , the one and only champagne popper , the love doctor your baby mother call me when she lonely my tailor see me twice a week , he like my homie forever grateful , forever thankful diamond necklace , but she wears it on her ankle the bitch is trendy my enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me i'm bankin' two million a show for the residency nevada gaming commission in a frenzy how much money can this casino lend me ?

Money in the Grave,rap,drake,2019,1344569,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)
[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave

Really just lapped every nigga in the race

Guess I got the mind of a little man
[Bras] are like women, about how you hit a man
Then she tell a story, this shit kinda bitter man
This is a nut [?], about how you did it man
You never hit, so you feel like a silly man
She never mention the spot that you fillin' in
She keep on tellin' your friends, your head in a spin
You can't even win, your head in a dance
She won't let it in, you spend it on her, she spend it on him
You see a check, then you see a grand
As soon as you speak, I pace as [?]
A face in the sand, a face [?] her man
And ya'll take your pictures, save it a chance
She call you a name, you scratchin' your chin
Like who is this nigga man, who is a [?]
You finally get it, you catchin' ahead
Suckin' your head, I'm far out the wing
And she tried to vent 'bout she wasn't in
How she really good, how she ain't a pimp

I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 1: Future]
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string
[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
Self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's a ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from, they serve the soda clean (Clean, clean)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it
[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 3: Drake]
Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Déjà vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà
Déjà

Alright, so unfortunately, I'm still here (Hahaha)
But, you know, if you're here, it's still up
In the building
And you just wanna hear some chune, some music

I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT

Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma

Condo in Miami, sold that shit to Chalmers
I stay on the beach when I retire
I can't miss a game, I been on fire
I'm thinkin' money when I sleep now
That's the only thing that get me geeked now
Someone got a problem every week now
Oh, now, they talkin' beefs, now
Gotta make peace and stay a hunnid (Stay a hunnid)
All my girls bad, times a hunnid (Times a hunnid)
And I'm going hard, times a hunnid (Times a hunnid)
I'm tryna see a hunnid, times a hunnid
For the guys, for the city and the gang
I might appear if you keep calling on my name
Put a curse up on you, things are getting strange
You ain't lie when you told me that I changed

Aye, 2 A.M. with my departure
Jug out to Miami, flew in charter
Stay one hunnid, look at me I've been in charge (Charge)
Oh, you know I'm 'bout to sauce on you (Sauce)
Suggest you lighten up, I might go dark on you (Sauce)
Hey, pull up, pull up, skrt, vallet park on you
Ayy, King Kong, climbing up the charts on you
Oh, goddamn, say my life is full of drama
Hot boy, I feel like Dwayne Michael Carter
(Sononous on the beat)
Life been good since I became a father
Thought you said a kid would make it harder
No-no-no, trust me it just made me smarter
I cut some niggas off, put some real ones on the roster
Never mix the real niggas with the impostors
Keep them niggas far from us, I say, ""Fuck 'em all"" (I)
I say, ""Fuck 'em all""
I just checked all my accounts and my money sittin' tall
Nigga, shut your fuckin' mouth, ain't no need to air you out
Niggas know what you about, heard you goin' through a drought
Must be why you talkin' down
Boy I know

Yeah, look

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 1]
Stay in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust
[Interlude]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 2]
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
I wish you could see
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

In her ear one time

'Cause she heard it all

Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, oh

Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you, if I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right, then who will I complain to?

There's things we might discover

You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last; Tunechi

[Verse]
I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

When To Say When,rap,drake,2020,637263,"[Intro]
Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
""Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?""
(June, you're a genius)
I said, ""I respect it, no problem""
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real

[Verse]
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, ""Damn, coach, put him in""
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

All of my brothers are black, carry me

Bought a Patek Philippe in your currency

That's how a man get blem, you and your friends
This Hermés from runway, this ain't Ralph Lauren
Tell them again, loved her way back when
Drunk so I type ""Je t'aime"" but don't hit send
Send some bread to the pen
All my G's are blessed, we check in for them
Whole lotta charges laid to this day
No confessions for them
Man really feel no ways, these man waste
No progression for them
Think you're bad, just wait, food get ate
And that's just lessons for them

Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, ""Babe, I think there was a typo""
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit

I got a Drac' in the studio, and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head

She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight

Zodiac Sign,rap,drake,2020,126736,"[Verse 1: Drake]
You ask how many girls I been with in my life
I tell ya, ""I stopped keeping count when I was 25""
I ask you the same thing, you tell me, ""Seven guys""
But we both know that's a lie
'Cause if we countin' head and if we countin' drunken nights
Then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine
But it's still nowhere close to mine
Marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times
He took over like four years ago when Courtnee had resigned
I been talkin' sex with Courtnee since like 2005
We been friends since junior high
Tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line
She's like, ""Is it more than a hundred, with everyone combined?""
And I say, ""Yeah, that's bein' kind""
At one point or another they all felt like they were mine
I had a lot of backs that I would never talk behind
I'm not really into threesomes, I like one thing at a time
I like when it's you and I
Plus I always feel like if somebody outperforms you
That could jeopardize your pride and I'm not into choosin' sides
Unless you 'bout to sleep and you askin' me what's my side
It's the right at home, but this a hotel so you can decide
Lessons that I learned before hittin' my prime
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
Things you need to hear 'fore we say our goodbyes
Free myself of it all, watch a Scorpio rise
Yeah
[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
You say you wanna know but you don't though
Why you wanna know who I cropped out of photos?
And lately, papi, you been acting tonto
What you think before you, I was only movin' dolo
But I'm honest 'til I die, so I won't lie
And I prolly got some numbers that you won't like
And you're prolly gonna hate it
But I much rather be hated for the truth than for the wrong guy if he ain't done
You can't be this good without some badness
What? You think I fuck this good without some practice?
And if it's LOV and you're my MVP
Then why we talkin' about practice?
Like you want me to lie
Why would I jeopardize my worth, just to value your pride?
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
'Cause then I switch up and I blame it on my Gemini
Might be jealousy, 'cause you just want me tradin' lives
Jealousy, 'cause I can get the girls and get the guys
And if I'm honest, this whole convo's just a waste of time
'Cause legacy should be my focus, not here playin' wife",en,"you ask how many girls i been with in my life i tell ya , ""i stopped keeping count when i was 25"" i ask you the same thing , you tell me , ""seven guys"" but we both know that's a lie 'cause if we countin' head and if we countin' drunken nights then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine but it's still nowhere close to mine marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times he took over like four years ago when courtnee had resigned i been talkin' sex with courtnee since like 2005 we been friends since junior high tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line she's like , ""is it more than a hundred , with everyone combined ?

[Chorus: Drake]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

[Verse 1: Drake]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like ""pardon my reach""
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my niggas don't love me
We should sit down before shit turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me
[Chorus: Drake]
Never had a lot, this is all I need

Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Niggas wanted to kill me and y'all still with 'em
Nigga, y'all chill with 'em, and y'all wonder why we not friends?
Best thing I can do is not build with you
When I could destroy you, that takes some fuckin' discipline
I could send a team to come drill you
I got a billion or two and I know where the fuck you live
Niggas gotta chill with talking gangsta
You should just thank us, humble yourselves a little bit
This ain't the same Shawn that you knew once
I don't shine shoes, uh, this ain't what you want, no
All that back and forth on the internet
Nigga, we don't tennis that, y'all gotta do something, yeah
Only thing we 'spect now is violence
Anything besides this, we playing violins, uh
I'm public enemy
Niggas wanted to kill me and y'all want me to be friendly
Niggas want sympathy after they wanted to end me
Be those closest to it be the very ones that envy
Shout out to the family
I don't want no friends no more, not many understand me
Everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing
But everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, ""I've got to make it out""

[Chorus]
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute
[Verse 2]
I mean maybe I'm confused, 'cause I thought that we was enemies, yeah
The big you is like a mini me
Like BIG U, man, I'm a legend in my city streets, yeah
Niggas peep, I wrote this shit while I was whippin' streets
Like fuck the law, I dropped Adonis off and pick a beat, yeah
Ballin' by the beach, like Miami Heat, yeah
Presidential suites, we don't get impeached
I talked to God standin' up straight, I don't get on my knees
That isn't me, that's not the person I was raised to be
Just wait and see

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shit is jumpin' in my bank account
You know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, ""I've got to make it out""

Deep Pockets,rap,drake,2020,240171,"[Intro]
For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'
[Chorus]
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

[Verse 2]
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention
[Chorus]
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'

Hey, Instagram
This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
[Interlude: Drake & Dennis Graham]
You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it
Okay, hahaha

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
[Outro: Drake & Dennis Graham]
Yes, sir

Hold on, hold on

Man, get the fuck away from us, we don't want nothin' but money

Because a lot of niggas doin' lot of Fugazi shit out here, man

All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell

[Verse]
All you do is lie to me
And dub me, you never love me
Any confidence I came with, you take it from me
I just wanna get beside you and make you love me
I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin' me
See you makin' all this time for more important things
We was s'posed to catch a vibe the other night
Busy now, but you was down that other time
Why you always lead me on and give me signs?
I just wanna get beside and make you mine
I just wanna come inside and reunite
Got me waitin' outside (Hah)

Love me, save me, tell me, try me

Uhm, you was just so in your pocket, uhm
Cats used to tell me when they used to come to my house in Miami and shit
That, that, that they felt a feelin' of like
They felt a lil' fucked up in they stomach
But, they was inspired 'cause they knew they, they, they had somethin' to see the dream for, you know?
I done seen a lot of shit, I ain't never seen a, a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since, you know, Michael Jackson
And then, when you've finally got the crib (All you do is lie to me)
You did it like, not even none of us did it, you feel me? Uhm
Nah, I mean I did it like that, I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie to you
I did it like that, but, I ain't never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me
How cats told me that he'd been inspired (All you do is lie to me)
And felt that feelin' in they gut, like ""I gotta work harder"" (Need more than a homie)
Well I mean workin' harder just to compete, bro, for real, for real
It's either you fuckin' in the game or you're out the game
Nigga, I'm back in this motherfucker, let's get some money

I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down, yeah

And girl, I know you got your spies, when they happen to catch me in a lie
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I'm sorry that I'm super late
I was drivin' here jammin' them Lil Boosie tapes
Understand that I do not envision, I hallucinate
I'm the type of nigga you could never ever duplicate, but
Let's talk about the babies me and you could make
We could do it anywhere, baby, you just choose the place
I hope I'm not being inappropriate
But maybe if I peak under the table, you could show me it?
Let me get a quickie, speed stick, no deodorant
To cover up the smell 'cause your parents are the nosiest
When you famous all the bitches wanna throw you it
But even with a bunch of women, you could be the loneliest
I tend to ask more than I can give
Or wait whatever's next and just get bored of what it is
That's probably why I'm keepin' you around
Was looking for exactly what I found
I just hope you stay down

Babygirl, I hope you rep for me for real
And when they get to stereotypin' a nigga
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
Listen, even if you slightly doubt me
When these bitches start to writin' books about me
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Everything about me cataclysmic
Big, obscure on every characteristic
I don't know what you're used to, but I'm a little different
Tremendous with credentials, resume is so prolific
Enough of that, despite I'm promisin' one in the booth
Always been a specialist at messin' with the best forbidden fruit
Never did I witness beauty so amazin', get it to the point when I see her, she glowin' like an angel with it
But after all the years of doin' it, I need an understanding with a woman good with followin' my lead
And though she finds it sexy and she loves that I'm the power, even in a crowded room, discreetly touching on her private
And when we goin' through a moment when we feelin' iffy
Believe in shit you hearin' while I question if you with me
You see that line of chicks? Let's go around the corner, waitin' and hopin' you drown, I just hope you stay down
I can't help the women lovin' everything about me, why you passin' judgement?
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
I know it's hard to trust me, all this money got my baby mama tryna fuck me

This ain't no regular shit
We never beggin' for shit
Niggas is ready to quit
Shit that they hate to admit
In Texas, I keep a rifle inside of the whip
Call it drivin' a stick
In Vegas, I get two million a night
From the Wynn, just to run through the hits
All that on top of the chips
Cash 'em all out, then I dip
Bet on fifteen 'cause of Nip
My pocket get blue like a Crip, ayy
What a slime to be alive
You don't want problems with the guys
She wanna come through just to vibe, well
We got different things in mind, well
London been treatin' me very well
Whole lotta chocolate and caramel
I cannot drive to the hotel
Might end up sleepin' in Annabel's
Summer, all I did was rest
New Year's, all I did was stretch
Valentine's Day, I had sex
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
[Chorus: Young Thug]
What a time to be a slime, uh
Hit that pussy from behind, huh
What a time to be a slime, uh
Flipped it up and left a lime (Slatt, slatt), uh
What a time to be a slime
Niggas bitter when they ain't in they prime
What a time to be a slime
Niggas get rich, they say you droppin' dimes

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
This ain't no regular shit
I don't take regular shits
I could go Michael or Prince
Or I could keep the score how it is
I took a trip to the Ritz
I took advantage of the bitch
I told her to feed me some grits
Then I put on my shoes, and I dipped
If niggas tell you they fuckin' with me
I'ma gon' tell you that's caninini'
Opps say I'm never knowin' where that they be
Bitches be sayin' they always see me
I took two years off and now I'm OD

Didn't read the caution and now it's elite

This shit could have went a hundred different ways on a thousand different days for real
Yeah, whoop, ayy

[Verse: Drake]
On my way to the boat like I ain't just have on a coat when I landed
Owl branded
Perched at the edge of the branches
They don't wanna talk mansions, mine look like a campus
And I'm all about my brothers like the niggas I'm samplin'
I'll leave you red-shirted like the twins from Kansas
Really livin' my dreams I used to have in my aunt's crib
Might throw a Rockefeller chain on in the Hamptons
This shit sound like I'm parked in the alley by ransom
My uncle went bankrupt and he was the last hope
My faith started to dwindle 'cause that was the cash flow
My mom would never walk again, that's what the doc said
So much medication, I was worried she'd drop dead
For real
And I was the good guy, my friends were the hotheads
Times when I thought I should of stuck with my old friends
I might've been at the end of my rope on both ends
The kids I went to high school with got trust funds
But we had more fun, trust
Textin' my promoter, homie beggin' for one plus
Girls wrote me off, didn't think I'd become much
Dinner and a movie all for nothin', that's tough love
Meanwhile, rappers from other cities is cuttin' up
We ain't had the means to really make it, we comin' up
But local niggas actin' like we made it and runnin' up
My heart beatin' fast 'cause I needed to toughen up
We needed to huddle up
I felt like we was doin' all we could but it wasn't enough
Spent a year in Brampton with my girl, just cuddlin' up
'Til one of my niggas hit my phone like you want it or what?
And now, the sound is champion
The singles is dancin', the pills is Ambiens
The lightin' is ambient
The housewives is outside the booth 'cause they can't be in
""Oh, you fancy, huh?""
Oh yeah, I'm the fanciest
They said summer was canceled but I got plans and shit
Where my advances is?
Ladies, it's June, July, where all the Cancers is?
Show me your hands and shit
Even if you ain't a Cancer, throw up your hands to this
'Cause most of y'all cancerous
Michael B. Jordan call you right now, you answerin'
Even if you got a man that love you, you scandalous
You gon' take the chance and shit
You know that relationship is probably in shambles
And you know you a fan of his
Know if he gon' bring you to Miami, you scramblin'
And pack all your luggage, get on the plane and land in it
Yeah, I'm just talkin' outta pocket now, I know y'all sick of me
I looked at the score and y'all can't be countin' the victories
It's still all love between us, despite all the history
It's still October forever, minus the trickery
Talk about a flip the switch challenge
It's been challengin' for ten years
'Cause niggas been out here switchin' on me
And showin' how much realer that some of they bitches can be
This shout goes out to Hov 'cause it's him and then me

Race My Mind,rap,drake,2021,320525,"[Verse 1]
Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Then you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me, no
Say— Say I'm so crazy, baby (I'm so crazy)

[Chorus]
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, mind

[Verse 2]
They said you got high as the sky
Up all night just dancin', huh
I hit you like, ""Please come home to me"" (Come home to me)
But you're not understandin', no
You gon' make me beg, make me plead (Plead)
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
I just figured you could make time for me
Since that you're comin' home intoxicated, oh, yeah
[Bridge]
Race my mind, I got the keys, please

[Verse 3]
Picture me rollin' through downtown in a A4
Picture my signature on a pair of some J 4s
Picture me carin' what niggas sayin' on Wi-Fi they don't pay for
Knew I needed love, but I think I value the hate more
To push towards things that I prayed for
Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no ""K, sure""
Soon as I tell you that you the one I would wait for
You too saucy, too flossy, you moved in and moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough
How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love getting T'd up
Love showin' the cakes, you know that they eat it up
Love touchin' the road as soon as it's heatin' up
Invited you over, you said that you showin' up
All them spelling mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was
Them niggas just can't understand it
I want you to change my mind, I'm praying you pulling up
Know who you be around, I know that they teaming up
Telling you you better off leavin' me in the dust

I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys

Laugh Now Cry Later,rap,drake,2020,1324950,"[Intro: Drake]
Woah, woah
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows

Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?

I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

(Six)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind

I pray these niggas understand how passionate the tale is
To get you under my pressure
Richer
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Yes, uh
Biggest, you feel me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Godfather with a garden full of snakes
Call Porsche, time to give away a Wraith
Bricks boy, tryna turn 'em into bass
Big boy, I been tryin' buy the Braves
Courtroom soundin' like I'm in the opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count monеy all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Tеddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up
Death row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's All Eyez on Me
Pinkie rings, it's still M.O.B. (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandy had me on my Urkel
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Patty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I fucked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get a leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
""The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino""
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)

Fireworks Demo,rap,drake,2021,319,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the papеr with
I hope that my success nevеr alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
When I go off like July 4
Feels like a fire, gotta go higher
[?] revelation, my sweet celebration
Ride me like a rocket
'Cause can't nothin' stop it
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
When I go off like July 4
Feels like a fire, gotta go higher
[?] revelation, my sweet celebration
Ride me like a rocket
'Cause can't nothin' stop it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 3: Drake]
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks
[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
When I go off like July 4
Feels like a fire, gotta go higher
[?] revelation, my sweet celebration
Ride me like a rocket
'Cause can't nothin' stop it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks

I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be (Yeah)
Senseless sight to see
Yeah
Senseless sight to see
Ayy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'
[Chorus: Drake]
I'm outside, twenty-nine, G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security
[Chorus: Drake, Travis Scott, Both]
I'm outside (Yeah), twenty-nine (Yeah), G5, seaside

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Rollin' 84s, it ain't no safety
Ridin' rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown, as I'm goin' out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep (Oh, oh)
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony (Sick)
Worry, sick, I'm sick of worryin' (Sick, sick)
It's just the world we in, I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (Yeah)
Early-mornin' shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant (It's lit)
I'm never settlin', this shit get darker than my melanin (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
At the crib all by myself, this shit be cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (Yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (Break it)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (Let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents
I'm droppin' the top, not to feel the wind
I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (Oooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my lead
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh), I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is (Oh, oh)

I'm outside (Ah-ah, ah-ah), twenty-nine, G5 (Ah-ah, ah-ah), seaside

Champagne Poetry,rap,drake,2021,689929,"[Part I]

[Intro]
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll

[Verse 1]
I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosе guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are high still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the
[Interlude]
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll

[Verse 2]
Champagne poetry, these are the effortless flows
Supposedly something else is controlling me
Under her picture lives some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me, I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money
Nigga, I'm wilding with your bread, you owe it to me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I don't have to second-guess nothing with no one I love
'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much
Think I got to scale the love back 'cause

[Interlude]
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
[Part II]

[Intro]
Yeah, oh
Heavy day
For real
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah

Oh yeah, yeah
Kept the Galleria open 'til ten for you and your friends
You know how I spend in H-O-U-S-T-O-N
I get too crazy, had a little baddina
We stay good friends, we get too wavy
All I know is that when this cup ends, the next one begins
My bae, you know me and you knew me back then
And you know how it goes when I see you again
You know I'm making my way to your ends
And you know I need you to be there for me

[Verse 2: Drake]
You a little Post Oak baby
You a little forty-eight baby
Got a little candy in her pocket
She gon' take off like a—
You already know (Know, know, know, know)
Dirtied up a cup, I'm on the Northside
Text you but I know you probably courtside
No, I got to come and check the whole man, baby, hold tight
I just touched the city with the G-block stainers
And we got it adopted by some fifth ward strangers
You know what it means when I twist these fingers
Me and you been on a first name basis
Why you think I hate it when you talk that Drake shit?
Same reason that you never left me hangin'
Same reason that I tried to make you famous
Same reason that I tried to show you just who I was
[Chorus: Drake]
Outside of the club, outside the things that a man like me does
Outside of the things that would cause you to judge
Outside of the club
Show you just who I was
Outside of the club, outside the things that a man like me does
Outside of the things that would cause you to judge
Outside of the club

[Verse 1]
Look, me and Lil Sandra bagging CDs in the bubble wrap
People recognize me from the TV, but I'm done with that
People don't wanna see me succeed, this shit come with that
Even when I come back, I don't know if it's me that's gonna be coming back
Soon as I left, I had to make peace with that
Dropped out of school 'cause nobody was teaching that
The Best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at
Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts
Even if they make a movie 'bout us, this shit'll be hard to re-enact
Dislocated shoulder, it's hard to be always reaching back
All these IOU's, it's hard for me to be keeping track
Friends that dedicated they life to just keepin' me intact
Hard to pay 40, pay Noel, pay Niko back
All the nights I needed to vent to someone and CJ sat
All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at
All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed
Or times he had to double back (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I mean, even with his salary, you can't put no prices on that
There is no salary cap, there is no payin' him back, for real
I wonder what it could've been if I had snakes in the mix
Actually, I never wanna know 'cause we made it like this
Shots gotta fly either way, now I make it or miss
Overtime hours all good, we take it in shifts
What would you do if it wasn't this? That's a hard one
The finish line is where I like to pull up and start from
Pain is just a place that I go to get the bars from
Anxiety's a drug that I use to get the job done
Delusional's a space I like to think that I'm far from
My son is the one thing I hate to be apart from
Bet against me, don't know where they getting the odds from
I know that when it's done, I'm going wherever God's from
But I still don't know where I get the calm from
(Where I get the calm from) Yeah
[Interlude]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah (Woah, woah)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied
I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line
And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline
Sometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind
I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time
Like, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?
They've been tryna push a narrative since '09
And they even had my ass convinced a couple times
But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times
Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes
And it's whatever with them niggas on the other side
We got problems we could never really put aside
I cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside
I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die
So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)
My hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off
I'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff
Houses paid off, label paid off
My soul for the money wasn't the trade-off
Unlike most of you boys that fade off
I feel guilty taking some days off
Please don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off
I mean, if you comparin' it to what I really made off with
I'm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off
Trust me it was nothin' light, holmes
They tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home
I know you love me
Can't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on
Unless Kawhi wanna run it back
Other than that, the strings'll be unattached
Certified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that
Y'all music gets watered down, when you love 'em back
And you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters
Said you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard
Oh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more
Soft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it
I'm always tryna rekindle
From the bottom to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?
From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter
To my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter
For the young Gs out here starting from the beginning
Nobody praying for you when you winning, don't forget it (Winning, don't forget it)

Fucking Fans,rap,drake,2021,279321,"[Verse 1: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm still working on me
And I'm coming back better for you (I'm comin' back, oh-ooh)
Most times it was my selfishness and your helplessness that I took advantage of
You sit in the house and I be out and I know you're worried, up (I know you're worried, you're worried, you're worried)
And you try and block it out
I'm so sorry for letting you down (Oh-oh, oh-ah)

[Refrain: Drake]
I should've came home, came home sooner
You'd probably still be there if I
Came home, love you like I treat ya
You'd still be there
My girl, my lil' baby speechless
You'd still be there, baby

[Verse 2: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm still working on me (Work it)
And I'm coming back with a plan and there's money in my hand, baby (Work it)
You said I was fucking up when I was out here fucking fans, damn, and it made you look crazy
Made you seem, made you feel, it was crazy (Ooh-ah)
While you sit in the house, I be out and you stay worried about me (Oh)
[Verse 3: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Nights when I just needed to hold somebody
Feeling overwhelmed, should've told somebody
Picturin' it's me sending chills through your body
I just probably should've chilled 'til I saw you
How am I supposed to get to know somebody?
Nigga left his 20s and I still wanna party
I can not be trusted on my own with nobody
I can not be
If we broke it off then you know it wasn't painless
If she got a watch then you know it's not a stainless
I was out here fucking fans, I was shameless
Yeah, and I know that
You was at the crib reading stories that they sent you
Most of that was bullshit but some of it I did do
Hard for me to justify the women I was into
Especially when the whole entire world wished they had you
Then I locked the door that night in Vegas 'cause I had to
Then I had a kid even though I never planned to
I cannot imagine when your girls gave you that news
I know that
Probably made you want to hit the streets on everything
Probably made you want to pour bleach on everything
Probably made you want to kill me on everything
Yeah, trust, I know that (Trust, I know)
Dialing, I'ma say two, zero, one, four
'Cause you're on the same shit that you was on before
I know you're not happy, girl, everybody know
Could see it in your boyfriend eyes at the show
Don't tell me let it go, I'm a letting go pro
You don't wanna grow but we gotta outgrow
Went six digits on the lock screen code
You crack  into that ho and it's gon' be a lot of smoke
We both getting rich but the trust getting broke
Tear me down with words but I know that's how you cope
Cover up a lot, can't cover up your soul
Know you're not happy, girl, everybody know

7am on Bridle Path,rap,drake,2021,678470,"[Intro]
Yeah (Go Squad)
Ayy
Look

[Verse]
I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho
With the ho ratio, I'm like David Caruso
Thеre's a mad shortage of peoplе givin' me kudos
I been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us Nuvo
You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, ""True, though""
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call ""R.I.P. Nipsey""
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man, fuck a ""Respectfully,"" I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
While you over there tryna impress the nation
Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'
Niggas textin' ""Bro,"" but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with frozen faces
They used to tell me back in the day, ""Boy, you're going places""
Never understood where I could really take it

Yeah, he hit us up and now we owe you something back

See, I was young angel but these niggas turned me evil
Yeah, I know I know you, but you really ain't my people
Yeah, I heard some people say they know 'em as my equal
Truth be told, I son these niggas, girl, I don't compete with 'em
Ask about The Boy and they gon' say they got the streets with him
Niggas so offensive knowin' they don't have no defense
Why they always act like we can fix it with a meeting?
All that linking up, man, I'ma see ya when I see ya

You get Drizzy on a track, he'll put you on the map
Oh, it's like that? Hell yeah it's like that (Ayy)
And I got a contract, it's a max (Ayy)

I know that I hurt you
Yeah
I was a child trying to be a man
To all my sons worldwide
I walked out on my only son
All my juniors
I left you in your mother's hands
I apologize for my absence, I know I left you without an annual drop
And now I'm standing right here
I don't know how I expected you to get your clout up and get your money up, but
With tears, with tears streaming from my eyes
Don't worry
See your mother raised a fine young man
Daddy's home
And I know I missed so much of your life
Turn me up (Mario)

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah
Niggas know they need to stop
I'm standing at the top, that's how I know you never seen the top
Sierra Canyon parking lot lookin' like Magic City parking lot
Hear the talks when I walk by like you know it's over when we drop
Ayy, drop
Yeah, and I'm coming with the wop
Y'all niggas not poppin'
Fuck her, then she goin' shoppin'
Woah, I'm runnin' out of opps
They're runnin' out of options
Put 'em up for adoption
Sign my name on the dot
Ayy, this is not luck, baby, this no four-leaf, no horseshoe
I'm in the bank thinkin', ""Poor you""
I'm in New York goin' Jon Chetrit
Supermodels and they all sexy
Lock the door to the bathroom 'cause they doin' something that is not Pepsi
I'm just pourin' up the shots
I remember that I told you I miss you, that was kinda like a mass text
I remember that I told I loved you, that was really in the past tense
I remember that I told you I get you, truth is that I get around
Mentioned havin' us a kid, '42 hit, I tend to kid around
Yeah, on Benedict with the top down
Shorties out here gettin' knocked down
City coming off a lockdown
Rap niggas doing weak features for a pop artist 'cause they popped down
Used to wanna throw the Roc up, niggas know how I rock now
[Interlude: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
You know how I'm rocking now
YM forever
Big owl, big birds forever
Don't make me go get your mama to talk to you
'Cause if he gotta get your motherfuckin' mama to talk to you, you know what I'm sayin', I'ma bring that motherfuckin' big switch out
At this point, I'ma start collectin' child support the opposite way
You gotta pay me to be my motherfuckin' son, ha-ha-ha-ha

Look at me
Take a real good look at me
Don't turn away
Don't you turn away like I did my son
Look me in the eyes, junior
I'm making no more promises
For real
I'm trying to find the word to say

Yeah

Pipe Down,rap,drake,2021,389583,"[Intro]
(I'm working on dying)
Said you belong to the streets but the streets belong to me
It's like home to me (She belongs to the streets)
It's like home to me
I tatted your passport up
Now it's lookin' like a arm sleeve
Just know that was all me

[Verse 1]
And when you see Chanel, I wish that's how you saw me
That shit you tell Chanel, I wish that's how you called me
That raw shit, that honesty, yeah
You know I love you more than all them niggas put together
And it's a lot of niggas' trust, I put the list together
And it's a lot just to assume we're meant to be together
You gotta live that shit for real, you can't just say whatever
You could never tell nobody that you held me down
If it was ride or die then you should've been dead right now

[Chorus]
So I don't get how you're yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
All the things I've done up until right now (Right now)
I need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)
Writing down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)
Don't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?
[Verse 2]
Tried to run it back a hundred times
The world is yours, but the city's mine
I can't believe you put it on your mother's life
I can't believe you told me it was ride or die
'Cause you're not here, somehow you're still alive
True enough I know you from the other side
I set my expectations way too high
Yeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night
Angel eyes, but you've been giving me hell all night
I know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all
Just to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights
Why does your ex think we beefin', is that man alright?
That nigga can't even look at me, he fell off twice
And I'm back poppin', I still remember the day I saw you
I was on your ass like back pockets
Niggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?
So much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face
'Cause you're so two-faced, that I don't know which face
You're the reason we'll be going separate ways
You're the reason we cannot communicate
It's not the things you say, it's what you don't say
I'm not in your way, you're in your own way

[Chorus]
So I don't get how you're yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
All the things I've done up until right now (Right now)
I need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)
Writing down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)
Don't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?

Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

[Verse 1: Drake]
Told the girls to meet at Tao
Now y'all doin' shots, now them bitches got you fired up
Don't know who you talking 'bout, I'll put that on the Bible
Turnin' up on me, don't make me turn it back around
And you know
Think I'm Tiger Woods, the way I'm teed off thе 17
And you know pockets on whatever, jеans forever green
And you know, told me lotta things, but ain't say everything
But now I know every single thing, there was plenty things I didn't know
Plenty things you didn't say, was fuckin' with you anyway
Was fuckin' with you way before you had some confessions to make
You decide to take it to the grave, I know you gon' take it
And you know (And you know, and you know)

Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile

Okay, okay, okay
Trenches bitch, I got her a salon

It's not in the Bible to wife off one girl
I'm Muslim, I go by Quran
The way I be smilin' and holdin' my gun
She think I be mimickin' Von, Grandson
She only play me in the whip
India Royale cosmetic, I'm just promotin' my bitch
Drake song do a billion streams for sure, I'm just promotin' her shit
Nasty with it
Take her to Sono Bello and get her some ass and titties
Fashion nigga
Rhude call when they drop like send my addy with it
Bitch left me and I'm glad she did it
Know I be testin' bitches
Back to back, I'm wrestlin' with 'em
Lean voice, I'm raspy with it

Street life'll have you catchin' up to God quicker (Yeah, gang)
Sticker, AK-40 to your liver
Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (Gang)
Flipper, so much bread, I'm a gymnast
Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (Yeah, gang)

Kappa Alpha, me and my gang, we do all the steppin'

Yeah
I heard Papi outside
And he got the double-R droppy outside
Checked the weather and it's gettin' real oppy outside
I'ma drop this shit and have these pussies droppin' like some motherfuckin' flies
Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes
I despise
When I see you, better put that fuckin' pride to the side
Many times, plenty times, I survived
Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies

My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys
Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me
I come straight up out the 6, and we don't spare sissies

I fuck with her, and fuck with her, and her
I hit up err and tell him do the err, for sure
Voodoo curse, it got him while I flew to Turks
Know the dogs had to hit them where we knew it hurts

'Til his brains hang and his mama sang
And the pastor sang and them bullets sang
And them choppers sang and the choir sang

I'm on everything
Jacob charged me four-fifty for a tennis chain
US Open, had it on us at the tennis game
Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games
And my pen insane, and my men insane
There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing
Shit they doin' on that other side embarrassing
We in Paris with it, hundred carats with it
All this shit is for my son, 'cause he's inheritin' it

My girl got a girlfriend
Ain't tryna be out of shape, well, stay up on them curls then
If gym don't work, get surgery
I'll pay for that, my courtesy
Can't imagine no bitch curvin' me
I put in that work overly
I handle business
And I got two pretty bitches, keep 'em both on fleek
They got matching Benz and matching APs
Now they can really call each other twins
I'm cool with all the owners, they love me, so they gon' let us in
And bring all of your peers, it look better with more people
We got 1942, Casamigos, it's getting heated
They gotta follow us in the Uber, my car filled up with shooters
It be lights, camera, action when you with us, it's a movie
I don't drive my coupe to house parties, I'm tryna leave with two of 'em (Shh, shh)
Yeah, don't nobody know the shit that we do
She like eating pussy, I'm like, ""Me too""
I can't wait to get off work to go and see you
Please bring your girlfriend along with you
Y'all been on my mind too much, like what the fuck is wrong with me?
She said it's somethin' about the way your girl just makes her feel
Whatever you've been dreamin' 'bout, I swear to make it real
Just ride around the town with me

The jet is low, they make me take your trips, we fly by (Let's go)
No stress is on my brain, no worries here, I'm chosen (Yeah, yeah)
Made another way, my nigga, watch me go shine
When I close my eyes my world comes alive (Yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la
People grow, good times sometimes (Nigga)
Real niggas in life survive (Yeah)

Set the tempo, got a nympho on my line (Yeah-yeah)
Said she wanna unwind (She do)
And I'm focused on gettin' more
They too stuck on gettin' even, I'm ready for it
We should really be together more
'Cause I know we got some time but I'm never sure

Catch me ten-toes in the limelight (Yeah)
Fuck the world up, on my life, right (Nigga)
Sayin' I'm the one, she lie, lie

Okay, fine, I miss you too

Wharton County, Texas City, H-Town, baby
TSU ladies

[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit
[Verse 1]
I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid
I got a Drac' in the studio, and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit

[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to s—
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 2]
Her daddy is not around, mama is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight
[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to s—
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit

In The Bible Demo,rap,drake,2021,1424,"[Chorus: Drake]
Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

[Verse 1: Drake]
Told the girls to meet at Tao
Now y'all doin' shots, now them bitches got you fired up
Don't know who you talking 'bout, I'll put that on the Bible
Turnin' up on me, don't make me turn it back around
And you know
Think I'm Tiger Woods, the way I'm teed off the 17
And you know pockets on whatever, jeans forever green
And you know, told me lotta things, but ain't say everything
But now I know every single thing, there was plenty things I didn't know
Plenty things you didn't say, was fuckin' with you anyway
Was fuckin' with you way before you had some confessions to make
You decide to take it to the grave, I know you gon' take it
And you know (And you know, and you know)

Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Okay, okay, okay
Trenches bitch, I got her a salon
Gucci and Pucci, it's deep in her budget
She hittin' up Virgil for Louis Vuitton
It's not in the Bible to wife off one girl
I'm Muslim, I go by Quran
The way I be smilin' and holdin' my gun
She think I be mimickin' Von, Grandson
She only play me in the whip
India Royale cosmetic, I'm just promotin' my bitch
Drake song do a billion streams for sure, I'm just promotin' her shit
Nasty with it
Take her to Sono Bello and get her some massive titties
Fashion nigga
Rhude call when they drop like send my addy with it
Bitch left me and I'm glad she did it
Know I be testin' bitches
Back to back, I'm wrestlin' with 'em
Lean voice, I'm raspy with it
I did my dance one time on TikTok and went viral with it

Ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Refrain: Drake]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1: Drake]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows
[Chorus: Drake]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?

It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

I told you that I was a mess, okay
I get out of bed and get dressed, okay
I think about ways I could fuck on your friend
It's something I never confessed, okay
God got me to protect, okay
Mama, I paid out the debt, okay
Baby Keem waiting on wings
You fuckin' him now, I'm gonna be next, one day
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt (Skrt, skrt)
You wake up and floss like I'm not for gossip
You niggas fraud, like I'm in the moshpit
This ain't for stage freight, black out the tint
Then skrt off the lot, went turbo, ferocious, and I–
Your bitch on hypnosis, and I–
Tell the mama that I'm sorry, Baby
Keem way too impulsive, and I–
Baby Keem been a GOAT, we know
Baby Keem for the soul, we know
Keep these hoes on tippy-toe

Pick him up and wipe his nose

Mention Me,rap,drake,2023,28008,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Say you want my company
Sometimes I feel so naive
I don't wanna give up on you easy
Things aren't easy I agree
Why you wanna be this cold to me
Why you wanna make me make believe
Things aren't what they seem
And it got too deep girl, too deep
It's a problem

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Fell for you straight to the bottom
People ask what happened I go silent
I wouldn't even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me

[Chorus: Drake]
Now you wanna mention me
When you speak on mistakes
Now you wanna mention me
Like someone could replace me today
Now you wanna mention me
Some emotional statements were made
Now you wanna mention me
Mention me like your bored of me

Maybe this means

[Verse 2: Drake]
My yiy's too fried (Ayy)
All these thoughts in my mind
Motives too transparent for me
I know you don't care about me
Dealing with me like some wasteman
You think I live in the palm of your hand
I'm too understanding and patient (Patient)
Lightning might've stricken you right where you stand (Ooh)
And your karma, karma's gonna be a problem

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Fell for you straight to the bottom
People ask what happened I go silent
I wouldn't even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me

[Chorus: Drake]
Now you wanna mention me
When you speak on mistakes
Now you wanna mention me
Like someone could replace me today
Now you wanna mention me
Some emotional statements were made
Now you wanna mention me
Mention me like your bored of me
[Bridge: Drake]
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means

[Verse 3: Rema]
She did play with my energy, nonstop
You realize that you messing with a gangsta
Oh girl worry 'bout your karma
Tired everyday a lil drama
If you wanna leave just leave, no pressure
If you wanna leave just leave, no pressure
No no no pressure
I will miss ya
If you wanna leave just leave, no pressure
No pressure at all
(Another banger)

[Refrain: Rema]
My girl you whine
Make you dance
Make you move like a rasta
Move dirty wine
Make you dance like a dancer
Give me dirty dance
Like you do, belly dancer

I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1: Drake]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
Thеy want my life exposеd
They wanna know about thе highs and lows
[Chorus: Drake]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next

Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels or fuck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm
It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

I think about ways I can fuck on your friend, that's something I never confessed, okay
God got me to protect, okay
Mama I payed off the debt, okay
Baby Keem waiting the wings, you fucking him now I'm gonna be next one day
Skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt
You wake up and floss like I'm not for gossip
If you nigga fraud, like I'm in the mosh pit
This ain't for stage fright, black out the tint, then skrrt of the lot, went turbo, ferocious, and I-
Your bitch on hypnosis, and I-
Tell your Muma that I'm sorry Baby Keem way to impulsive, and I-

She knows I got some ho friends, she knows I'm a lot like them
She's not no dummy when I say, ""It's a work trip in Dominican""
She knows I'm sinning again, she knows
Good God, damn, I can't get shit by you
I can't be sleepin' on you, I wanna put some shit on you
Look how it sits on you, eugh, those tights might rip on you

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
**** tryna keep up, **** is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a ****, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This **** gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
**** ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a **** while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I **** 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto

Work No Play,rap,drake,2021,24,"[Verse 1]
Dropped a single but I ain't single no more
Momma pour me a drink please I need a little more
You hatin' me now don't act different when I'm on tour
Media think I'm losin' but never check the score
Been doing this shit a while never think about it
I just figured they'd get upset or offended by it
Ceiling comin' down only thing breaking through is my voice
Been figuring out the next step man it wasn't a choice
This shit was ramen goin' noodles at the garden
Melo still fighting for that ring, I beg your pardon

[Chorus]
Work with me
Ridе with me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Verse 2]
I stеp into the room and they speaking of the devil
New angels surrounding me for reaching the next level
We ain't playin' the same game
I'm a raging forest fire, you ain't a candle to this flame
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
Post award depression taking a toll on me, I got four
It's gettin' morbid in this house it ain't home no more
I'm sipppin' triple doubles
Double O seven I'm the greatest trouble
[Chorus]
Work with me
Ride with me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Verse 3]
When I leave I always come right back here
The young spitta that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game needs change and I'm the cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of kush shape the lines in my head
Shit been goin' on for too many years
I keep secrets, ask my father, ask my peers
Wheelchair Jimmy never saw this comin'
Only thing he'd say is to keep it one hunnid

[Chorus]
Work with me
