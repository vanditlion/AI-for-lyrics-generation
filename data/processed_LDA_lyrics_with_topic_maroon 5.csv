Oh
Oh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (Christina Aguilera)]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Woo, uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Oh yeah)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've got them moves like Jagger
[Bridge: Christina Aguilera & Adam Levine]
Uh, you wanna know, how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this (Uh)
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right, yeah
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Christina Aguilera]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Take me by the tongue)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (Yeah, yeah)

Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home, babe, 'til you come home
You taste best, the poison I've learned to love is gone
I'm all alone, baby, I'm all alone

I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh baby, oh
Give a little more, ooh baby, oh

Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
There's somethin' about my ego, tell her back up, Tim Tebow
Got Tivo up in the ride, I'm leanin' back and my seat low
You need hoes, I just sex 'em, bend the ass like Beckham
Undress 'em, respect 'em
Just for the night, then after that I forget them
Neglectin', I'm sorry, girl, turn the house into a party world
Probably gonna get herself played, Atari
No time for tears, if you cryin', call Maury
Got girls by the army, feelin' kinda horny
Love it when I'm on a Benny Blanc beat
Talk cheap, but I spend big
'Cause I

Harder to Breathe,rock,maroon 5,2002,79300,"[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
She said, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Bridge]
And does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting when you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold?

You'll understand what I mean when I say

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it ""Love""
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong

If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time

I'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?)
(Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]

I would still be holding you like this

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
[Verse 2]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam

Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

Payphone Radio Version,pop,maroon 5,2012,69851,"[Intro]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

And all those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

Ooh, yeah, yeah
Now baby, don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
I'm begging you, just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
Like, ""Oh, oh, oh,"" can't take it anymore
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other
Like, ""Oh, oh, oh,"" it isn't funny anymore

[Chorus]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, you never need to know
I don't wanna be picking up all of these
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your heart, won't do it anymore

[Chorus]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh

Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have a crystal ball
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all

And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder

But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row

When you haven't worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
Such a fu-fu-fucking snob that you'll never know the truth

You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, 'cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart

Wasted Years,pop,maroon 5,2012,7333,"[Verse 1]
Slow is the memory
And I can picture her standin' right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
And kind of driving her crazy
But I know she wants me
I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sitting on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty
But I know she wants me

[Chorus]
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry, yeah
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else’s tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

[Break]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax, you know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface, but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

[Chorus]
But I, have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else

Drowned in someone else's tears

'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do
I'm scared to stand right in front of you
The way our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact, you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is, baby, oh
Deep down you know, yeah

Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it

Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

Nothing Lasts Forever,pop,maroon 5,2007,35334,"[Verse 1]
It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you, but I'm letting go
It may not last, but I don't know
Just don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way
[Verse 2]
A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely, I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, baby

Doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh

But until then, the fact remains

Bathed in sunlight
By the bathroom door
You said you wished you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars

Mmm

I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be okay to show
My face around here (Face around here)
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

Would you ever turn your head and look?
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know, I think I should go

A helpless victim of a spider's web

The Sun,pop,maroon 5,2002,25376,"[Verse 1]
After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate
Images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun""
Oh, whoa, oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song, oh

[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun""

[Bridge]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on
[Chorus]
I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be

And we're only several miles""

When you refuse me, you confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again, my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

But you would rather walk away

Infatuation,pop,maroon 5,2007,4925,"[Verse 1]
Baby, I don’t wanna spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
I wouldn’t pass right by you
Maybe it's because you are so insecure
Maybe you plain don’t care
Maybe it’s the chase that really gets me off
I fall so when it’s just not there

[Pre-Chorus]
Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

[Chorus]
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It’s such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I’m touching your skin
If it’s only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
[Verse 2]
Try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be
Now I'm facing something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more

Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad

I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?
Oh-oh-oh

Don't you care about me anymore?

Come around here? I don't feel so bad

Wont Go Home Without You,pop,maroon 5,2007,60809,"[Verse 1]
I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say
Oh, oh
Words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
The noises that she made, kept me awake, oh
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

Not Falling Apart,pop,maroon 5,2007,5915,"[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don’t cry, you don’t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

[Chorus]
Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart
Ooh, oh

[Verse 2]
Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down; I wish you’d stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways, mm
Try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink
[Chorus]
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem? I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again

You’re such a flirt, I know you hurt
And so do I, I empathize
I see you out, you never cared
A conversation that we never shared
But it’s so strange, it’s something new
Amazing feelings that I have for you
I close my eyes when I’m alone
Wonder what it’d be like to make you moan

The world, it disappears so fast

Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don’t stop it before it begins

And spread your arms and legs across the bed
And when you shake, you won’t regret
The things I whisper in your ear

Back At Your Door,pop,maroon 5,2007,5515,"[Verse 1]
From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same
Like the taste of the day you left
That still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
A stain where you had wept
All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Three more days 'til I see your face
I’m afraid it’s far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up
If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You’re my reason for living
And there’s no way I’m giving up, oh

I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

And I’m eating home alone on a Friday night
I know what your friends say
""He's just wasting your love and time""
I will never let you change your mind

Miss You Love You,pop,maroon 5,2007,3429,"[Verse 1]
This has not been easy
This has been hard
I am scarred
And I do not know what to do with you
Going south, kiss your mouth, lick my lips
Grab your hips, can't remember why I fell in love with this

[Chorus]
But I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
Oh no, I don't need you

[Verse 2]
Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face
So don't go shooting up the place (Oh, mm)
Make no mistake, your love's not real
Cause the love that I got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel
[Chorus]
And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no

It was really nice to know you
I got nothing left to show you
Got bills to pay, get out my way, it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him

Losing My Mind,pop,maroon 5,2007,3475,"[Verse 1]
It's so hard to find you
I'm standing right behind you
The streets are much colder
This mean I'm getting older
Why would you? How could I?
These questions lead to goodbye
But now I got my freedom
Don't I?

[Chorus]
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

[Verse 2]
Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, You eat in
Hot from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up and goodnight
I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry ‘cause she don't love me
You got me completely
In my own game you beat me

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know

No this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

Until Youre Over Me,pop,maroon 5,2007,2789,"[Verse 1]
This relationship is over
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I'm gonna live alone
Why is the pain much worse?
You're so much better without makeup
Why would you hide your face?

Realize I've made a big mistake, oh

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)

But I am still in love with you

I never meant to keep you waiting
And now your food is getting cold
I keep denying I'm in love with you
My routine is getting old
And now you stand in front of the table
And say you never look back
Do something stupid when you're angry
You only wake up sad, oh

Impossible to be tamed
Her need; cellophane
I'm happy you like to play games
Why did you run away?

What he had, he'll never know

And I can see your getting it

Means that you're passionate
I’m happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last?

From this monotony

But by choice it’s gotta be

Slow down and lay with me
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet

Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard
Scream loud as we come apart

I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on
And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer day (Ooh)

Walking down the wrong side of the road (Ooh)

I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there

And now that I know exactly what I want

I can't seem to find the pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay, and she got up and ran away
Well, now I've had enough
Her pretty little face has torn me up

The pretty little girl I left behind

Looking for a place to call your own
Scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing, don't get upset

Unlike any touch I've ever known
And I never thought about you much

I do not mind if I die trying (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?

What's going on with him now?
And don't patronize me with lies

No Curtain Call,pop,maroon 5,2011,3104,"[Verse 1]
You say you need someone
But everybody does
I'm no different than you
I just believe what I do
You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who're only tryin' to help

[Pre-Chorus]
As it's winding down to zero
I am your unlikely hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever

[Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all
[Verse 2]
I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flames
Rather than running away

[Pre-Chorus]
As it's winding down to zero
I am your unlikely hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever

No curtain call, I will not fall

Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossing and turning, you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, you're in too deep

Searching for the right words

Stupid not to know it all along

And who threw what punch

Nothing’s all I got, oh

Do you mean all the things you are?
Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar
That only I have seen
Do you give just to please yourself?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
Justified all the things you tried
Said that it was all for me

And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Will you burn by the things I've said?
Took the dive just to feel alive
But never heard the truth
Now I'm in love but I don't know how
I'm in pain 'cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close
I slowly open mine

And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

I am so confused by this
I know that life is hit or miss
Days are stung by too much sun
I think that you may be the one
Cover yourself up in me
Shrouded in what could have been
I will listen to your pain
If you listen to me

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?

The Way I Was,pop,maroon 5,2007,2333,"[Verse 1]
Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right

[Pre-Chorus]
Where are you hiding? (Hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (Crying)
Just another crazy boy
Hungry for your

[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was

[Verse 2]
I tried and tried and tried and tried
But I have no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer
Life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh dripping from head to toe
[Pre-Chorus]
Where are you hiding? (Hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (Crying)

[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was

[Verse 3]
I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love
It was yours to take
Break down your door
Take a little more
When I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving
It's a new low
Try and pick me up again, but
Let go see how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your
[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was

I'm sipping champagne 'til we throw it up
I drinked enough for both of us
You talking way, way too fast for me now
So pour up everything to slow it all up
I talked about this ""finally famous"" lifestyle way back, baby when we was growing up
Made a few plays now everything that we talked about showing up, and I could chauffeur up
But I still get lost on the map to your heart
So far gone let's take it back to the start
To the part where we carved our name in the bark
Preserved all the feelings like it came in the jar
I guess life ain't no picnic basket
Put four years in and came out a bachelor
This time around how does me and you sound
Cause honestly to me it sounds mixed and mastered
Right?

Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
This is pain, this is love, this is sent from above
This a gift from the Gods, this was meant to be
You can run, you can hide, you can front, you can lie
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You a part of me and I'm a part of you
I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
J. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever

Oww!

If I Ain’t Got You Live,pop,maroon 5,2011,3255,"[Intro: Adam Levine]
Yeah, yeah

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
Oh, I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Promises forever young, wait
Some people need three dozen roses
Uh, and that's the only way to prove you love them, oh

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be? Oh
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

I am in misery
Yeah

[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start?

Give me the sweetest goodbye

Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away

Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I woke up this morning
With the burning of love hanging over my head
As I walked into the living room
Sit with you
Discuss what's going on

Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
Oh, tell me so that I understand

I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me

That I would never ever wish upon
Even my worst enemy
Who is she?
What the hell do you people want?

After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song

The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her

Sweetest Goodbye live,pop,maroon 5,2015,157,"Where you are seems to be as far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start?

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back, I have something to say

How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of run-around

Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe them anyway

So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I’m taking love
And it’s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don’t say a word

Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't think so

You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up""

Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

I hang your picture well
I frame it, maybe need a nail
Or some tape, to stick it on the wall
When I walk in, it stay
Or maybe Velcro
To strap your bows and patches on the elbows
In the coat when it's cold
I mean winter-cold
That's rain, sleet, hail, snow
Hell, no
She's lookin' at me like I sell bras
But, I don't, wouldn't, won't
I am not that guy
Cross my T's, dot that I
Say it's hard to breathe?
We are not that high
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
Breathe it in, out again
Oxygen, count me out
Ten products in the aisle that I cannot
Breathe in, shoots in and think
If they sink, I won't swim
Like I won't hold my breath when I float in this bitch
Backstroke, high-dive, diving boards don't slip
And belly-flop, knock the block outta your socks
And your feet in the water, there to shock ya
Make it harder to breathe

But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love

Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation

Our road is long
Your hold is strong

Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?

There you are

And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say ""I'm not there yet!""

You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of run-around
You know it's true

And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in

Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe them anyway

There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes

Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

(That may) That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline (Yeah, yeah)
Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, whoa)
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning

Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we

And it’s not my fault 'cause you both deserve

Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?

Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't think so

Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

I couldn't disrespect the crib, you brought a man where I live
Now my pistol pointed tryin' to leave led in his ribs
What's in something that I did, what's it time I did the spin
When I think about him, I think time you crack a rib
Call a preacher at the corner it all when wrong
David Banner, Maroon 5
This is bigger then the song, dawg
Yeah! Uh!
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

[Outro: Adam Levine]
I don’t feel so bad (Wake up call)

Makes Me Wonder Just Blaze Remix,pop,maroon 5,2008,236,"[Verse 1]
Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason (Reason)
And you don't have the time (Time)
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I

[Chorus]
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I?
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I?
So this is goodbye
[Verse 2]
Can't stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I

[Chorus]
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I?
So this is goodbye
Lying to my lovers eyes
So this is goodbye

[Bridge]
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore (Ho-oh-oh-oh)
You caught me in a lie (Ho-oh)
I have no alibi (Ho-oh)

Not Falling Apart Tiësto Remix,pop,maroon 5,2008,222,"[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don’t cry, you don’t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

[Chorus]
Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games

Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name

Better That We Break Ali Shaheed Muhammad  Doc Remix,pop,maroon 5,2008,254,"[Verse 1]
I never knew perfection till
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping is impossible too
Everything is reminding me of you
What can I do?

[Chorus]
It’s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday
Maybe we’re better off this way?
It’s better that we break

A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You’re scared and that you think that I’m insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity I can’t see it clearly
While you’re standing there, it disappears
It disappears

Saw you sitting all alone
You’re fragile and you’re cold, but that’s all right
Life these days is getting rough
They’ve knocked you down and beat you up
But it’s just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah

I’m sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don’t trust me
Why must we do this to one another?
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it’s over

A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

Well, I’ve got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
Embrace a devil so sly
You cannot hear 'em coming
‘Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere

Come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface

This Summers Gonna Hurt Like a Motherfucker,rock,maroon 5,2015,82261,"[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy
[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular (Whoo!)

Story - Non-LP Version,pop,maroon 5,2015,104,"Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Just another crazy boy hungry for your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
I've tried and tried and tried and tried
But I've no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer, life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh, dripping from head to toe
Where are you hiding?

I'm on the inside crying
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
And I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love, it was yours to take
Break down your door, take a little more
When I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving, it's a new low
Try and pick me up again but let go
See how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was

Dont Wanna Know Extended Version,pop,maroon 5,2016,13853,"[Intro]
Oh, hey

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Winter with the raindrop
You can make the rain stop
You can make the pain stop
Heart pumping, novacaine
Speed through the motor lane
Race to your doorstep, feign for the short thing
Issue that I miss you, wanna kiss you on your neck, aye
Get you then I pin you to the post on your bed, ayy
Feelings turn to a brickwall, there I was
Told me that you got a new love but I...

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home

Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Verse 3: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be? (What we used to be)

Are we taking time or a time out?

Acting like we're not together

Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Told me you would take the charge but you told on me
I thought that you rock with me but you rolled on me
How my best friend turn into my enemy?
I really love you, girl, but I don't need the energy
You broke my heart, girl and I can't find the remedy
Now me and you can't even be in the same vicinity
Your friends interferin', they should throw a penalty
And you can't see it but them bitches full of jealousy
You played yourself, you had the baller of the century

Whiskey,pop,maroon 5,2017,133059,"[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me

I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers, but she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn, I let it burn, yeah

Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh

Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey
Ooh, like a whiskey, ooh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh

I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

If I Never See Your Face Again Paul Oakenfold Remix,pop,maroon 5,2008,110,"[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway

I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away

But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Rihanna, Both]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes you burn to learn I'm with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

Now you've gone somewhere else far away

Never Gonna Leave This Bed Acoustic Version,pop,maroon 5,2011,683,"[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down, take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Verse 2]
So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out?
[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh
So you say, ""Go, it isn't working""
And I say, ""No, it isn't perfect""
So I'll stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

[Bridge]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get
Knockin' so loud, can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake, but you can't forget

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

I get drunk, I get high
Then you call and I lie
And say I'm on my way now

Show up when it's light out
When you're dressing for work
And I'm mumbling words
I don't know what to say now
No, I don't know what to say now

You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye

Parties with shots and powder
But you'd rather sleep eight hours
And I know you got your doubts
'Cause I can't turn this life around, baby
Thought it was just a phase
'Til I woke up a thousand days later
Realizing I'm the same as I was before I saw your face

I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà-vu

It's like I'm never riding solo
I feel you walking in my shadow
Never hit me quite like that though
'Cause now I'm under your spell
Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe
No one that can save me
'Cause now I'm under your spell

If I Never See Your Face Again,pop,maroon 5,2007,12763,"[Verse 1]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)

Cold VARN Remix,rap,maroon 5,2018,41,"Cold enough to-
Chill my bones
It feels like I don't-
Know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so-

Look
I don't mean to be the bad guy but-
Some would say that the shoes fit
And I been chewing on hearts like beef jerkey
So I got a lil stuck and I think I need a tooth pick
Fall fast and hard
Like I'm an Aston Martin
Off a cliff at dark
But I'm in at a bargain
Cause you ain't ever met another like me-
Young V, CD, make you go retarded-
I'm lyrically proficient when I'm driving the rhythm
But I won't let you up inside, you might need an incision
To see the corners of my mind that I often exist in
You want the pieces of my pie? Gotta make a decision
'Cause I been fizzing off the top, like a soda been shook
And I been pennin' down my thoughts, till I'm out of the books
Used to talk about the thots, ain't give 'em a look now
Listen to my hook now-

Chill my bones

Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive

Party with Maroon 5, sour got me red-eye
Oh, I'm a rockstar, baby

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway (Sway)
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one (Oh)
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before (Oh)
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

This is the remix
Everybody to the dance floor right now
Showtime!

Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away

But you feel my breath on your neck

Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind (Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time (Talk to me)

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah
[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls, yeah

I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love was more
Than just holding hands (I heard that)

[Verse 1]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
If I trust in you, oh now, please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh, please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see, oh, that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

Pure Imagination 2009 Version,pop,maroon 5,2009,85,"[Intro: Barack Obama]
A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

If you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world?
There's nothing to it

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves: If our children should live to see the next century? What change will they see? What progress will we have made? This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time

Tequila drinkin', double shot, yeah, I need you

I live my life tryna prove myself to non-believers, gotta stop that
The devil talkin', I block that
Got some homies in Heaven now, they watch my back
For all this pain, we numb it with champagne
Hunnid bottles in the club, that's a goddamn shame

Look

Lost fights, nigga, lost life of loved ones
Lost time, pressin' rewind, it won't budge
It's alright, you can tell me your truth, I won't judge
I done lost too, relationships you could call true
You hit me up and I'm gon' fall through
Tellin' lies to sound true, like it's all you
Learn to love what's imperfect, that's what God do

That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything
Too much on my mind, another pill and I'll be fine, yeah
That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
Sometimes, I feel out of my mind, but I'm not
Feels more like I'm out of my body
Sometimes, I'm in my own way, but I'm not
I don't really feel like anybody

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Stevie Nicks]
Walkin' in the sun, sun-kissеd face
Like candles in thе sun, I'm breakin' down
Take me now, I'm breakin' down
Just need someone to love me, to love me
[Chorus: Adam Levine & Stevie Nicks, Adam Levine]
Ooh, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart
Ooh, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Memories I can't relive, ran away from how I feel
That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything
Give no fucks, I never did, livin' like I never lived
That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
Sometimes, I feel out of my mind, but I'm not
Feels more like I'm out of my body
Sometimes, I'm in my own way, but I'm not
I don't really feel like anybody

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Stevie Nicks]
Walkin' in the sun, sun-kissed face
Like candles in the sun, I'm breakin' down
Take me now, I'm breakin' down

You wanna leave, I won't stop ya
But you're the one I would die for
The other ones come with sad stories
You're the one I go ride for
Waitin' to fall for over two seasons
In spring, I'm sprung for the wrong reasons
Baby, forgive me for rivers that I can't stop
'Cause my heart freeze in winter
I don't wanna be a savage
Done with summertime madness
Your sunshine works magic
Never thought I would ever know what that is

Wasted Years Live,pop,maroon 5,2005,37,"Slow is the memory
I can picture her standing right in front of me
Orange blossoms crushed on concrete
I walk around with bare feet
Cause I know you want me

Can't remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And I had already gotten there before I came
My tank is empty
And I know you're thirsty

I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to dry

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax
Cause I know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface, but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry

Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos

Hoping that I make it to the end of December
Twenty-seven years and the end of my mind, but
Holding to the thought of another timе, but
Looking to the ways of the ones bеfore me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely

I don't want to do it just to do it for you

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh

Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you

In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Paint a picture with my hands (No, no)

Harder to Breathe Live Acoustic Version,rock,maroon 5,2004,7,"[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we'rе gonna give up""
And like a little girl criеs in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Said, ""Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe.""

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

And does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting when you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold? yeah

After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate
Images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battlе's almost won
And we're only sevеral miles from the Sun.""
Oh yeah, yeah, oh

I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps, oh

And we're only several miles from the Sun.""

The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on, yeah
[Chorus]
I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Because things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles""
She said, ""The battle's almost won, oh

Wont Go Home Without You Acoustic Version,pop,maroon 5,2008,19,"[Verse 1]
I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
She left before I had the chance to say
Oh, oh
Words that would mend, yeah, the things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath, I'll never get over, yeah
The noises that she made, kept me awake, hey
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go

I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me, how did you get so cold?
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold
I don't understand why you're so cold

Cold R3hab  Khrebto Remix,pop,maroon 5,2017,13,"[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
