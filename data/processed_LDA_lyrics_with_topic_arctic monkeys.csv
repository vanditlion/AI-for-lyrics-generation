Piledriver Waltz,rock,arctic monkeys,2011,185864,"[Verse 1]
I etched the face of a stopwatch on the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
I heard an unhappy ending, it sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning

[Chorus]
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

[Verse 2]
Mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes
I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning
[Chorus]
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Black Treacle,rock,arctic monkeys,2012,104985,"[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings
In the sky at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain
On anybody's cabriolet
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it, just in case

[Chorus]
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

[Verse 2]
Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?
And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now
[Chorus]
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

[Bridge]
Now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesizer
And I tried last night to pack away your laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it

Reckless Serenade,rock,arctic monkeys,2011,92819,"[Verse 1]
Topless models doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

Caricatures of your wrecking ball gown

I wanna be in that damsel patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke
And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lighting up

On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

Linking arms, sinking hearts
And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes

The last one out to win a prize

The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala,rock,arctic monkeys,2011,86339,"[Verse 1]

In the eye of the storm

Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured,rock,arctic monkeys,2006,89123,"[Verse 1]
We'll ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
Well, you're coming up at our end aren't you?
So I'll get one with you
Won't he let us have six in?
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no, though
He didn't have to be rude
You see her with the green dress?
She talked to me at the bar
Well, how come it's already two-pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Didn't you see she were gorgeous?
She were beyond belief
But this lad at the side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Came and paid for her Tropical Reef

And I'm sitting, going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said, ""It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please""

Well, how funny were that sketch earlier
Up near that taxi rank?
Oh no, you would have missed it
Think it were when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up, proper shouting
'Bout who were next in the queue
The kind of thing that'd seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few
Well, calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
Well, you're acting like a silly little boy
Oh, they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
He said, ""No surrender
No chance of retreat""

From the Ritz to the Rubble,rock,arctic monkeys,2006,178278,"[Verse 1]
Well, last night these two bouncers
And one of 'em's alright, the other one's a scary'un
His way or no way; totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathing
How he don’t want you to, so step out the queue
He makes examples of you, and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think they want you all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
[Verse 2]
Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
Of course not

""Shall I keep rolling?""

[Verse 1]
Well, oh, they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there in't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see 'em then you would agree
Agree that there in't no romance around there

[Chorus]
You know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Verse 2]
'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music so that there's new ringtones
And it dun't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

Wishing they weren't there

A young girl's telephone beeps

There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that but architecture won't do
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care what they've got, keep on turning 'em down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up because it just won't happen

He's got the feeling again, this time on the aeroplane
There might be tellies in the back of the seats in front, but Rodney and Del won't do
Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

And the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill

And almost shouted
And then reality kicked in within us, it seems as we become the winners

Now you only get it in your night dress

Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle

When I asked her if I could call her your name

Huddled up in a wicker chair

Balaclava,rock,arctic monkeys,2007,137154,"[Verse 1]
Running off over next door's garden before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone?
Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish you'd never been born?
You tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

[Verse 2]
Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but she can hardly wait

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn

The Bad Thing,rock,arctic monkeys,2007,85028,"[Chorus]
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talking to me, but it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore
See, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure

But it won't make it that much easier

But I don't know that is what she isn't

And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response
Like, ""I don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really, love, it's fine""
I said, ""Really, love, it's fine""

Both sides
In softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss
Nice try
You cannot turn away, but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks
And with his index finger, flicks you on your socks

I go high-pitched
He'll talk and make your voice sound high-pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own
And whispered in your ear in that baritone
It's the same stone
His heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw
It's impossible not to feel inferior

And he could catapult you back to your daddy
Or into any hissing misery
And he will tell you how the day after a triumph
Is as hollow as the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying bye

And hang around to watch some poor girl blub

How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?

Dance Little Liar,rock,arctic monkeys,2009,95611,"[Verse 1]
I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend
The guilt is what you will require
And still you've got to dance little liar
Just like those fibs to pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
And you're bound to trip
And she'll detect the fiction on your lips and dig a contradiction up

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time

[Verse 2]
I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh, no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes, that will get you back to normal
And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch
The varnish off that newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon
[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

[Bridge]
The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones? And in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled
With the wrong memories?

Crying Lightning,rock,arctic monkeys,2006,316869,"[Verse 1]
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are

I'm pinned down by the dark

[Verse 1]
Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well-told gripe, the most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
Sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze, then to my knees you do promote me

About as bashful as a tribal dance, the first and final chance

Divided up into two teams

A welcome threatening stir
My hopes of being stolen might just ring true
Depends who you prefer
If it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where, I'll meet you there

Am I snapping the excitement
If I pack away the laughter and tell you how it feels?
And does burden come to meet ya
If I've questions of the feature that rolls on your dream reel?
The day after you stole my heart
Everything I touched told me
It would be better shared with you, with you

And now you're hiding in my soup
And this book reveals your face
And you're splashing in my eyelids
As the concentration continually breaks

Didn't heal as fast

Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?

No Buses,rock,arctic monkeys,2006,128000,"[Verse 1]
Lady, where has your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found
Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
""No chance, you'll get nothing from me""
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be, just like me

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

To hold you by the hand
Must you first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more
Just once more

Smoking, drinking, drag riding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless youngsters, no direction, no sign of correction

Run the area like, ""Oh, my days""
But a lot of my naughty friends, they're not phased
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things that we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just one

Potion Approaching,rock,arctic monkeys,2009,53309,"[Verse 1]
I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms
It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean

[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna hang on

[Verse 2]
I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Ah, she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd spend it chasing after you
'Cause she's not shattering my attitudes
No matter how she folds the potion
Yours is the only ocean
[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to

Holding a token, swollen in size

The Jewellers Hands,rock,arctic monkeys,2009,97465,"[Verse 1]
Fiendish wonder in a carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly, stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek
You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless
And weightless, your imagination runs

[Chorus]
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

[Verse 2]
In the moonlight they're more thrilling, those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit
Was like falling off the ferry in the night
The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
He became laughter's assassin
Shortly after he showed you what it was
[Chorus]
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

Too Much to Ask,rock,arctic monkeys,2007,69547,"[Verse 1]
The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns
Am I too quick to assume that the love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune
To what they did before, her head's red raw
And the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
When you sobbed before
It felt much more like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more

[Chorus 1]
And there would be, oh, it's uncertain
Whether the curtain has shut for good
She said, ""See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it""
And, ""If you loved me–""
And I interrupted, received a scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there

[Verse 2]
Would it be outrageous to say
We're either shouting or we're shagging?
Docked in tempestuous bays
Or at least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier
And whether you're asleep or awake
[Chorus 2]
Is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me
As Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask

Sketchead,rock,arctic monkeys,2009,13698,"[Verse 1]
Sketchead is coming to your party
He's walking up your drive and he's swinging all his keys around
Sketchead, he's seen you with your top off
He already knows your boyfriend, retain your introductions
Sketchead, that cumbersome protagonist
The pips in your quince, the eye behind the spy hole
The itch you can't itch in your ear
And the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints

Sketchead, there's poison in his spit
He'll compliment your tits and leave you to your wits
Sketchead, convincingly insisting
The tyres were bald when you gave him the car
Sketchead, still coming to your party
Still walking up your drive and still swinging all his keys around
On his finger as a pendulum to unnerve

And then there's you, you've changed
I approached you like you were the same
But soon it was apparent a new name was required
New lips went and fired accomplishments at me
While I'm captivated by your magazine skin
The tint on your lenses obscures to begin
And you know full well
That anyone who says that they don't prefer the sequel

Listening to the fools, tickling the rules

His hair is purposely unkept
In many doorways, people wept

Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies

Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too

To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]

Fright Lined Dining Room,rock,arctic monkeys,2009,20023,"[Verse 1]
You thrive on dancing in our laps before the more familiar chaps
Who know the curtain leads to fever
We watched the womaniser cry, and in the last sip
You and I declared we might require a breather
I am the truth's true truant
I can feign excitement fluently as solid as I can busk shock
With well-presented merriment
And I know all too well I shouldn't break the key off in the lock

And the tumble splits the frame
Revealing silk and fits
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

The days drag their heels
When you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sachet of brats
The old pantomime villain follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs
And he spies through the slats
And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing

Rocketing shutter doors despite the shop not opening for hours
You can itch, flap and whistle and try to avoid the tock

Arabella,rock,arctic monkeys,2013,825277,"[Verse 1]
Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
And I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

[Chorus]
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind

It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light

The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling

When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone

No. 1 Party Anthem,rock,arctic monkeys,2013,554635,"[Verse 1]
So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
[Verse 2]
She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya
To do me no good
And you look like you could

Knee Socks,rock,arctic monkeys,2013,638012,"[Verse 1]
You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you’re kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats, all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Verse 2]
Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
‘Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter’s in full swing
And your dreams just aren’t comin' true
Ain’t it funny what you’ll do?
[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Post-Chorus]
The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your knee socks

[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

[Interlude: Josh Homme]
All the zeros lined up
But the number’s blocked
When you’ve come undone
[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste

And you listen to the scores

I want you down on all fours

And men are mere mortals who

So who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
I can see it in his eyes, yeah that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know?

[Verse 1]
Although you're trying not to listen
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
""I'm sorry love, I'll have to turn you down""
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous?
And he don't have to say 'owt

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
She don't stop in the winter, no and

Crying Lightning Acoustic Version,rock,arctic monkeys,2015,12401,"[Verse 1]
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude
As you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix

Said ""You're mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been called 'cold' before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you have left and it was going to waste

[Bridge]
[Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called

[Chorus]
Crying Lightning
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons
[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on it's way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war
And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Bridge 2]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called

[Chorus]
Crying Lightning
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

[Outro]
Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning
[Verse 3]
Oh you were reading a book about some idiot and telling me about another
I was so severely underwhelmed I thought I might never recover

Straighten the rudder girl and sail me up stairs
And go and find somebody who cares
Well we might not be the perfect partners but tonight we make a pair

[Bridge 2]

The Lovers,rock,arctic monkeys,2013,9127,"Up from the pastures of boredom
Out from the sea of discontent
They come in packs like hungry hounds
Up seekers of the dark enchantment

They haunt the boulevards and bars
They pray to wishing wells and stars
They ride the hurricane of hope
Not looking back, but on they go
Toward the distance and deceiving
And all the while they keep believing
They are special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers

And when they pair off two by two
They feel they are the chosen few
And though their beds are made of straw
They feel like velvet in the night
And so the night is never ending
Its made of distance and pretending
Coz they're special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers
And when love goes away
And when love goes...
Goodbye...
Catches in their throats like cotton
Rises in their hearts like rain
The good times suddenly are all forgotten
The hunt begins again

They search the subways and the streets
Their faces tired, like their feet
Their bodies aching to be warm
And so they hide behind the moon
Their loneliness inside them growing
But they take comfort in just knowing
That they are special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers

And when love comes again
And when love comes
Hello...
Rises from their throats like singing
Catches in their hearts like wind
The good things
Strangers in their arms are bringing
Makes life all right again
They turn their faces to the light
No longer hiding in the night
So unashamed and unafraid
That they can face each others faults
And though the waltz will have its ending
There is no harm in just pretending
That they are special and apart

Star Treatment,rock,arctic monkeys,2018,461425,"[Verse 1]
I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap
[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

[Verse 2]
I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, ""Long Hot Summer""
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?

The Ultracheese,rock,arctic monkeys,2018,259605,"[Verse 1]
Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
And didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

[Verse 2]
What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway, and his sons
'Cause it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just tryna orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone
Because you had the chance

I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl (Stop)
Back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland
Say, ""Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk""?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (Stop)

And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five

To describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in

Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls

Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

Vengeance Trilogy wallpaper walls

Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts Demo,rock,arctic monkeys,2004,3040,"[Verse 1]
There's always somebody taller
With more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her
And her friends think he's fit
And you just can't measure up no
You don't have a prayer
Wishing you had made the most of her
When she was there

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged
No intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird
And he'd probably kick your head in

[Chorus]
Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts
You're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Oh no
[Verse 2]
He might be one of those boys
That's all pretty and vain
Likes to go in the sunbed
And stays out of the rain
So that he don't get his hair wet
You wouldn't want that
At least he hasn't got a Nova
Or a Burberry hat

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged
No intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird
And he'd probably kick your head in

Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts
You're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Of course you were

[Verse 3]
Have you heard what she's been doing?
Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gates
At twenty past three
She's been with all the boys
But never went very far
She wagged English and Science
Just to go in his car
[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged
No intention of a wedding
He's pinched my bird
And he'd probably kick my head in, oh
Now the girls have grown
But I'm sure they still carry on in similar ways

With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

Brian, top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't get our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Spoken Interlude]
We are the Arctic Monkeys from High Green, baby!

[Verse 2]
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
Shе'll be saying, ""Use me, show mе the jacuzzi""
I imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm
[Verse 3]
(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?

Crying Lightning Live,rock,arctic monkeys,2020,652,"[Verse 1]
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravatе the ice-cream man
On rainy aftеrnoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are

Do I Wanna Know? Live,rock,arctic monkeys,2020,1250,"[Verse 1]

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new

Crawlin' back to you

Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt

I don't know if you feel the same as I do

Of bumpin' into you

Incapable of makin' alright decisions

When there were tears on the steering wheel drippin' on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart
Hold on to your hеart

And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do mе a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions

'Cause she walked away while her shoes were untied
And her eyes were all red, you could see that she'd cried
And I watched and I waited 'til she went inside
Forcin' a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

A song about a search for the Albert Hall

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And smooched whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she squeezed me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
""Pleasе, can I call you her name?""
[Chorus]
And I elongatеd my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself, woah

[Verse 3]
I thought I'd caught you in the Parrot's Beak
Fiddlin' with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, it was so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

[Bridge]
So tell me, where's your hiding place?
You see, I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

[Chorus]
I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself
[Spoken Interlude]
Mr Jamie Cook on the electric guitar!

[Verse 4]
Well, I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
Well, that's when I knew that she'd understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, ""I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want""

It's gotta be now, innit?
Now, now

[Verse 1]
You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats, all piled high
When I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I've got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That we were tryin' not to light
And you're the stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
‘Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter’s in full swing
And your dreams just aren’t comin' true
Ain't it funny what you’ll do?
[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your (Knee socks)

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

Arabella Live,rock,arctic monkeys,2020,673,"[Verse 1]
Arabella's got some interstellar gator-skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
And I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

[Chorus]
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries, but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
Arabella

[Post-Chorus]
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

[Verse 2]
Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration
She's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place
[Chorus]
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries, but it's just not as kind on the eyes

That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it, I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips 'round a Mexican Coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like
Woo!

Last night these two bouncers
And one of them's alright, the other one's a scary'un
His way or no way, totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathing
How he don't want you to, so step out the queue
He makes examples of you, and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain, you'vе got something to prove
To all the smirking facеs and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?

But secretly I think they want it all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

Pretty Visitors Live,rock,arctic monkeys,2020,674,"[Verse 1]
Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm
But the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned
And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move ’round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
Unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry
Ooh

And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

What came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill-fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk

Canopy 19 is perfectly placed
For the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away, I’m unhappy to say
Behold as the crook in the hammock plays

And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Behold as a crook in the hammock plays
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale

This is ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor""
Don’t believe the hype

Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to

[Pre-Chorus]
And your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you’re an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't like the sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
Don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on thе dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop likе a robot from 1984
From 1984

I wish you’d stop ignoring me
Because it’s sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
And I don’t think it's very fair

Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)

Star Treatment Live,rock,arctic monkeys,2020,573,"[Verse 1]
I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to therе, impressive moustache
Lovе came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap
[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

[Verse 2]
I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, ""Long Hot Summer""
They got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Oh, baby, that is not how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

R U Mine? Live,rock,arctic monkeys,2020,1044,"[Verse 1]
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartache
That come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Well, are you mine? Oh, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire
[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?) Oh, ah

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, ""You got me, baby
Are you mine?""

Ah, that's a big shadow
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

And I can't help myself, all I

A Certain Romance Demo,rock,arctic monkeys,2004,136,"[Verse 1]
Well, oh, they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there in't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them then you would agree
Agree that there in't no romance around there

[Chorus]
You know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, 'cause their minds arе made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Verse 2]
'Cause ovеr there there's broken bones
There's only music so that there's new ringtones
And it dun't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

Don't you know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know

Fake Tales of San Francisco Demo,rock,arctic monkeys,2004,71,"[Verse 1]
Fake tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
And there's a super cool band, yeah
With their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)

Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces at thе back, all
Wishing they weren't thеre
And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah, she's dashing for the exit
Oh, she's running for the streets outside
""Oh, you've saved me,"" she screams down the line
""The band weren't very good and I'm not having a nice time""

I don't want to hear you, no (Kick me out, kick me out)
