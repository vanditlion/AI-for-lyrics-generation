Ghost,pop,halsey,2014,340618,"[Intro]
I'm searching for something that I can't reach

[Verse 1]
I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

[Chorus]
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
[Verse 2]
You're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy
I'm off the deep end, sleeping all night through the weekend
Saying that I love him but I know I'm gonna leave him

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

[Chorus]
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

[Bridge]
I'm searching for something that I can't reach

Hurricane,pop,halsey,2014,333221,"[Verse 1]
There's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where a boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

[Chorus]
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
I'm a hurricane
[Verse 2]
I went down to a place in Brooklyn
Where ya tripped on LSD
And I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me

Though lately, I like 'em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me""

Trouble Stripped,pop,halsey,2014,111364,"[Verse 1]
Would you bleed for me?
Lick it off my lips like you needed me?
Would you sit me on a couch with your fingers in my mouth?
You look so cool when you're reading me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek

[Chorus]
But I've got my mind made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight
[Verse 2]
Would you lie for me?
Cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me?
Would you pin me to a wall?
Would you beg or would you crawl?
Stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me?

Is There Somewhere,pop,halsey,2014,174715,"[Verse 1]
You were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room
Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
I just wanna feel your lips against my skin

White sheets, bright lights, crooked teeth, and the nightlife
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldn’t let you complete me

I'm trying not to let it show, that I don't want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
'Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutched my brain and eased my ailing

[Verse 4]
You're writing lines about me, romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
'Cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain but you're stuck in my brain
All I do is cry and complain, because second's not the same

How hard I tried to breathe, through the trees of loneliness

It was somethin' in his eyes when I kissed him
Listen, feeling like I can't dismiss him

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue

He don't know what it means

You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
He said, ""You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too""
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece

You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you

My demons are begging me to open up my mouth
I need them
Mechanically make the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and angry
Watch them pounce
Ignite me
Licking up the flames they bring about

And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees

Telling me I’m running out of time

A chest filled with diamonds and gold
The house was awake, with shadows and monsters

Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockefellers

But now I think I'm possessed
You put a fever inside me
And I've been cold since you left

And you've got your own mistakes in a bed at home
I'm hoping you could save me now, but you break and fold

I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?

I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake
I found the devil

In his color-coded speak

In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I found a martyr
He told me that I'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs
I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine

All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign

BADLANDS Trailer,pop,halsey,2015,13436,"Hello, and I'm sorry
A salutation and a farewell
I don't have much time

This Times New Roman is going to fly from my fingertips like a plague of moths
The hollow black letter shells crunched into the ground like the skin of a cicada
This is all that's left, and you can do whatever you want with it
Keep it to yourself or let it serve as a warning

This city is disgusting; a corpse of what it used to be
The people are filthy, gluttonous
Ruled by the power exchange of sex from the hands of the proletariat to the bourgeoisie
The tops of the skylines buzz with the lackluster enthusiasm
The ground level is caked in dirt and rust and grime
And the people that dwell there wake and rub the filmy layer off their lukewarm eyes

There are some here I love
Some who fear me
And some who wish I was dead

I didn't ask for this
No one asks for this
You're born into it
You grow up oblivious and sheltered
And one day the evil realities of this place hit you square between the eyes like a perfectly aimed bullet
If this were a movie

Haylor was conceived, we panicked cause we knew

She'd always got around, we thought she'd take a walk
And desert him, desert him
Desert him, him, him, him, him

But she's still here, in the city
And we realized that we can agree

That we knew she was trouble when she snagged Styles
How could we allow Taylor to get him with her fake smiles

But all she really wants is a track for her CD

I hope he see-e-e-e-es

Never seen someone make
Pink so pretty
Play make-up and
Dresses litter the floor
Smile's chasing her cheeks
To her eyebrows
We'll laugh until our tummies
Get sore
Only five years old and she's
So nervous
Daddy blows out candles and
He sweats
Too young to understand this
Birthday
Will be the best gift daddy ever
Gets

She said her body held a monster
And she needs help tryna
Fight it
And she knew it when he
Crossed her
That it was wrong but she
Could right it
And she took my hand

And I said ""please
Put up your fists
Put on a smile
And blow them a kiss
Cause darling, you're
Nothing but brave and I know
That you can be saved
We're gonna chase down the monster
We're gonna chase down the monster

Glitter painted toenails and
She stands tall
Says ""mama, Santa's coming soon""
Mama laughs and chokes the tears
Back, says ""baby girl, he's coming just
For you""

So precious, sings to every song
On the radio

Was written just for Ruby cause I know

Tilt You Back,pop,halsey,2014,4062,"[Verse 1]
I saw two faces in the light of a dead end street
Begged them for a smoke and we started to speak
Countin' bricks in the wall and my voice cracks
I said, ""You see I got this boy and he don't love me back""
So we walked for a bit and Jesse grabbed me hard
He said, ""Come back down to Earth from wherever you are""
But his words don't register, I'm lost in your eyes
And this dial tone will kill me by the end of the night

Come on and wrap me up, let me tilt you back and swim
I want your taste on my tongue, won't you warm my bones within
Reveal yourself to me, on this dark and empty street
Oh you can feel yourself in me, swallow you down so easily

It's gettin' kind of late so I thank 'em for their time
Trip over sidewalk blocks and slurred words I know aren't even mine
And Jack's a better friend than Jesse because he puts the pain to ease
So I know I'll be alone tonight despite how much I plead

The kind of love I can't return, but I'm gonna borrow

[Chorus]
Your eyes meet mine
The lights are playing shadows right down to your collar
Your love is calling
I'm praying you'll do anything to stall her
I'm sorry darling, I know he's yours
I know you make him breakfast and fit between his arms
Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing your broken love
I'm sorry darling, I know he's yours
I know you wear his class ring and I don't mean you any harm
Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing your broken love

You laugh and offer some honest conversation
Catch me in the cracks between your crooked smile
Your words are more like illustrations
Toss your head back, but I know you'll stay a while

Your eyes meet mine
The lights are playing shadows right down to your collar
Tonight I'm borrowing a broken man
I'm borrowing your perfect love
Your love is calling
I'm praying you'll do anything to stall her
Tonight I'm borrowing a broken man
I'm borrowing your perfect love

Tell me, how can a heavy heart be so empty?
You left all your baggage on my steps when you went and left me

I know you make him breakfast and fit between his arms
Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man

Wasting time, lost in love
We can go where no one will ever find us
So let's waste time
While we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes up

[Verse 1]
We've got no place to go
But we can make it on our own
We're drivin' slowly, down a country road
We can keep on through the night
If I got you by my side
I see the stars reflected in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Think we got something special
Living life like we are rebels
You know we've got potential

While we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes up

If the road gets tough
Being with you is enough
We're singing all the songs we used to love
We've got nothing to lose
And we're out with something new
But it all feels like home when I'm with you

Think we got something special
Living life like we are rebels

Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
And you're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearing through the pages and the ink

His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue

Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
You said you'll never be forgiven till your boys are too
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

Everything is blue

[Verse 1]
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you

And I'm thinking of your skin

The Prologue,pop,halsey,2017,115872,"[Intro]
Two households, both alike in dignity
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love
And the continuance of their parents' rage
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend

Money hungry, prideful country
Grass is green and it's always sunny
Hands so bloody, tastes like honey

Well, King Midas put his hands on me again
He said one day I'd realize why I don't have any friends
I find myself alone at night unless I'm having sex
But he can make me golden if I just showed some respect

[Refrain]
But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said, ""I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door""

And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything

And I find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans

Every single one's forgotten in a laundromat machine

I've missed your calls for months it seems
Don't realize how mean I can be
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
That I love like jewelry
'Cause I can change my mind each day
I didn't mean to try you on
But I still know your birthday
And your mother's favorite song

So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
Ooh ooh oooh

I run away when things are good
And never really understood
The way you laid your eyes on me
In ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again
I failed to see it from the start
And tore you open 'til the end

And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind

Good Mourning,pop,halsey,2017,110393,"[Intro]
They told me once, ""There's a place where love conquers all""
A city with the streets full of milk and honey
I haven't found it yet, but I'm still searching
All I know is a hopeless place that flows with the blood of my kin
Perhaps hopeless isn't a place, nothing but a state of mind
They told me once, ""Don't trust the moon, she's always changing""
The shores bend and break for her
And she begs to be loved, but nothing here is as it seems

Here we go, fist fight in a limousine

Angel on Fire,pop,halsey,2017,169735,"[Verse 1]
I woke up to another mess in the living room
Broken bottles all around my feet
They came again in the night under crescent moon
Didn't wake me in my sleep

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause they talk and drink and laugh 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
I hide and cower in the corner
Conversation's getting hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody seems to care 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
In the background screaming, ""Everybody, look at me""

[Chorus]
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
I'm standing in the ashes of who I used to be
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire, fire

I used to be a darling starlet like a centerpiece
Had the whole world wrapped around my ring
I flew too closely to the sun that's setting in the East
And now I'm melting from my wings

And fall in love in my backyard

Bad at Love,pop,halsey,2017,1141618,"[Verse 1]

And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again

And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah

Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude

Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

You said I would've hit the ceiling
You said I
You said I should eat my feelings

And I went tumbling down tryna reach your high
But I scream too loud if I speak my mind

Sold out arenas but I do it in a tank top, yeah
See, 100 got that new drop
We makin' records, breakin' records off a laptop
Feelin' good when I wake up
Listen to Khaled when I'm puttin' on my make up
Me and my mans would always fight and then we'd break up
So I moved on and put some zeroes on my pay stubs
I lost some things, then I found them
I got some day ones and I always stick around them
This summer droppin' and I know we gon' astound them
And plus I went and I put Quavo on the album

Just got myself a baby blue Chanel
I used it twice, despite the price, and put it on the shelf
And when I roll up in the club, no one can ever tell
Stay in the back, so I can grab all on his Gucci belt (ha!)
But we don't got no label
Don't really want bottles
Nothing in my nasal
Wanna keep it lowkey
Sneak under the table
DJ play The Weekend, tell me are you Abel? (okay though)
Love, love, love, makin' love still
It's been a minute, but he always get it rough, still
He callin', ask if we can do it in the tub still
And so I pull up (brrrt-brrrt)

I'm searching for something that I can't reach

I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye

'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?

Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy

I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams

And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again

And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine

Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

Bad at Love Hook N Sling Remix,pop,halsey,2017,1128,"[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)

Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away

Alone Remix,pop,halsey,2018,152633,"[Intro]
If I

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah

[Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Unh, look
I'm a real rare individual
I'm in the physical and the metaphysical (yeah)
I know you need your alone time, that's critical
But I need some of your time, is that hypocritical?
Damn, you know I relate to you more than fam
So I won't sit around and let you sink in quicksand
Look, I know you got million dollar plans
And you tryna build a brand, live a life in high demand
Swerving big b's, your bag got little G's
Gucci down to the socks like Biggie and Little Ceas'
Let's hit the Maldives and hide behind palm trees
Little red wine, weed, and a calm breeze
'Cause baby, you been living life inside a bubble
When the last time you had somebody hug you?
Hold up, when the last time you had somebody love you?
Hold up, when the last time you love someone who love you?

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey, Big Sean]
You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it (for real)
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
[Verse 3: Stefflon Don]
Stay up ina me all night ana rock

Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It’s to the point where I love and I hate you
But I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want this to end
I should’ve listened to my friends, no
I put this shit in the past, and I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil boys had the prettiest face?
I gave you a heart that was full of mistakes
You gave me your heart then you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart break again
You made my heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart break again

Along the lines of social suicide, I refuse to die not by your side
So I'll take what I can from you, then I'll hide
And save the ""Lucid Dreams"" for another time

One, two, one, two, three

[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck around, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo, solo, solo
Solo, solo, solo
[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in Hell there's Heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in Hell there's Heaven
(Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish somebody would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo
[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in Hell there's Heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in Hell there's Heaven

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors
[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I’ll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

[Pre-Chorus]
You're drippin’ like a saturated sunrise[sunrise]
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it’s blue

Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don’t know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I’ve lied with you
He said, ""You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too""
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

Girl, I've been way too much to handle
Bitch, I've never been a good example
""Seen, not heard"" is what they told me
I look too good to be this lonely
Oh, grab this loaded gun
So hopeless, but I'm still romantic
Bloodstained mouth, gonna blow a kiss
And I bet it tastes like me, yeah

You burnt the witches, now you're defenseless

I'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue, it's violent rain
And in my world, the people on the street don't know my name
In my world, I'm seven feet tall
And the boys always call, and the girls do too
Because in my world, I'm constantly, constantly havin' a breakthrough (Hmm)
Or a breakdown, or a blackout
Would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?

'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some

Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
And can you feel it too when I am touchin' you?
And when my hair stands on ends, it's saluting you
The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
And the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
Left my shoes in the street so you'd carry me
Through a breakdown
Through a breakdown or a blackout
Would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine?

Without Me Albert Vishi Remix,pop,halsey,2019,258,"Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?

You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Think I'm makin' a mistake, but if I decide to break
Who will fill the empty space? So...

Apart from my beating heart

I really was born at 9:29 AM on 9/29
You think I'm lying, but I'm, I'm being dead serious (I gotta see this birth certificate)
Okay, I'll prove it

[Verse]
Well, who am I? I'm almost 25
Can't remember half the time that I've been alive
'Cause half was in a cheap apartment
And half was on the Eastside (Eastside)
They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos
And God knows that they were right
Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you
Then put you on a feature on the B-Side
And who do you call when it's late at night?
When the headlines just don't paint the picture right
When you look at yourself on a screen and say
""Oh my God, there's no way that's me""
And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried
And I bought another house, and I never go outside
And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit
Well, she told me
She said, ""Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die
'Cause we need you,"" and honestly, I think that she lied
And I remember the names of every single kid I've met
But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed
And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee
And hoped that my father would finally call me
And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours
And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower
Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder
But then I realize that I'm no higher power
That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now
And I'm so happy I figured that out
I've got a long way to go until self-preservation
Think my moral compass is on a vacation
And I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation
I'm still looking for my salvation
[Chorus]
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
Watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself

[Interlude]
I think I have a confession to make, I feel like (So we know you don't)
I need to say that I was really born at 9:26
It's on my birth certificate, I'm a liar
Man, I'm a fucking liar

Finally // beautiful stranger,pop,halsey,2019,435052,"[Verse 1]
Your eyes, so crisp, so green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet
Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but I can't resist
And I said

[Chorus]
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists

That's a lose-lose

Told me pick my battles and be pickin' 'em wise
But I wanna pick 'em all and I don't wanna decide

Tell me, have you ever keyed a Ferrari before?
Oh no, I don't anymore

And I won't ever feel this way again

So where do you go?

Pull up to the drive and I remember the codes
Yeah, the only fuckin' numbers you don't hide in your phone
No more, no more, anymore
Climb up to the window and I'm breakin' the glass
Then I stop, 'cause I don't wanna Uma Thurman your ass
No more, no more, anymore

When a house ain't a home
Is it true, honestly
When it's all a part of me?
A couple years of waiting rooms
Finding God, and lose Him too
Wanna scream, but what's the use?

Lyin' awake, and I stare at the door
I just can't take it no more
They told me it's useless, there's no hope in store
But somehow I just want you more

Somehow, I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more

Wooden floors and little feet
A flower bud in concrete
Feelin' so incomplete
Wonder will we ever meet?
And would you know it right away
How hard I tried to see your face?
A little screen, a photograph, mine to take

I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer
I cry and my knuckles get sore
'Cause I still believe it won't be like before
And now, somehow, I just want you more

Somehow, I just want you more

Kiss her on the neck, little baby is a poser
Thinks she's so cold, but the world is colder
Take her in my lap and I'll promise that I'll hold her

I keep a pistol when I sleep
Inside my mouth so I can shoot
Down all the bad things

Hold Me Down Live for Like A Version,pop,halsey,2016,161,"[Verse 1]
My demons are begging me to open up my mouth
I need them
Mechanically make the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and angry
Watch them pounce
Ignite me
Licking up the flames they bring about

[Pre-Chorus]
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna

Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
[Verse 2]
Selfish
Taking what I want, and call it mine
I’m helpless
Clinging to a little bit of spine
They rush me
Tellin' me I’m running out of time
They shush me
Walkin' me across a fragile line

I had a vision and I watched it come alive
And now I'm wishin' that I had a bit more time
I have been achin' in my bones at night
Conversations with my bloodshot eyes
Hard to focus when the pressure makes you blind

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanted was to make some art, talk some shit
Didn't really care about getting rich
Now they make this hard
Tryna make me quit
Maybe for the thrill of it

[Chorus]
Baby, hold me
I'm looking for a little bit of honesty
Take me, slowly
Give me just a little, baby, promise me
There's a hollow in my chest
And you can take whatever's left
Baby, maybe
You could give me just a little bit of honesty
[Verse 2]
I've been sleeping in a bed too big for me
Can't remember what it's like to get some sleep
I've fallin' victim to a homesick life
Got a cravin' that I just can't buy
God, I wonder if I'll ever make it right

You should be sad Mike Mago Remix,pop,halsey,2020,229,"[Verse 1]
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

Walls Could Talk Nightcore Remix,pop,halsey,2019,400,"Been about three days and I'm comin' back

Here we go, fist fight in a limousine

And I go, I'm wastin' a Saturday
Sittin' at home
Told my new roommate not to let you in
But you're so damn good with a bobby pin
Now you gon' play me like a violin
Hittin' these notes
And we both hope there's something

Not my fault, you win every game we play
There you go,making me always take the blame
Why you so low?
On your knees
I come back 'cuz you want me too
But you act like I’m the one who’s haunting you
'Cuz you won’t ever look at my point of view
With your eyes closed

He says, ""Ooh, baby girl, you know we're gonna be legends
I'm the king and you're the queen and we will stumble through heaven
If there's a light at the end, it's just the sun in your eyes
I know you wanna go to heaven, but you're human tonight""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with the sounds

[Chorus]
And do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
And do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us arе just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with thе people underneath
And they're running, running, running

And we'll be running, running, running

He says, ""Ooh, baby girl, don't get cut on my edges
I'm the king of everything and my fucking tongue is a weapon
There's a light in the crack that's separating your thighs
And if you wanna go to heaven, you should fuck me tonight""

But I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool

Would you bleed for me?
Lick it off my lips like you needed me?
Would you sit me on a couch with your fingers in my mouth?
You look so cool when you're reading me

Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek

Can you see his silhouette?

And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight

Would you lie for me?
Cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me?
Would you pin me to a wall?
Would you beg or would you crawl?
Stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me?

They fight me, vigorous and angry watch them pounce
Ignite me, licking up the flames they bring about

I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He's got me down on both knees
But it's the devil that's tryna

Hold me down, hold me down

Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock mе out, knock me out

Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles
Just what you'd expect inside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockefellers

Survival of the richest, the city's ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
(But we don't feel like outsiders at all)

We are the nеw Americana (Oh-oh)

But he could never love somebody's daughter

So he vowed to be his husband at the altar

Drive Live from Webster Hall,pop,halsey,2020,756,"[Intro]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep

[Verse 1]
My hands wrapped around a stick shift
Swerving on the 405, I can never keep my eyes off this
My neck, the feeling of your soft lips
Illuminated in the light, bouncing off the exit signs I missed

[Chorus]
All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride, all we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California nevеr felt like home
And California nеver felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing
[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah

[Spoken Interlude]
You guys aren't new here so you know what to during this part, right?
You know what to do during this part
And if you don't you better learn fast

[Verse 2]
Your laugh echoes down the highway
Carves into my hollow chest, spreads over the emptiness, it's bliss
It's so simple but we can't stay
Overanalyze again, would it really kill you if we kissed?

[Chorus]
All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride, all we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing

Hurricane Live from Webster Hall,pop,halsey,2020,707,"[Verse 1]
There's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where the boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

[Chorus]
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in thе pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
I'm a hurricane
I'm a hurricane

See, I wеnt down to a place in Brooklyn
Where you tripped on LSD
And there I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me

'Cause there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

Roman Holiday Live from Webster Hall,pop,halsey,2020,660,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember the taste of my lips that night
I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?
'Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall
That separated the dining room
And I remember the fear in your eyes
The very first time we snuck into the city pool
Late December, with my heart in my chest
And the clouds of my breath
Didn't know where we were running to
Don't look back

[Chorus]
'Cause we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
So for now, let's get away
On a Roman holiday
[Verse 2]
Could you imagine the taste of your lips
If we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens?
'Cause I'll imagine the weight of your ribs
If you lie between my hips in the backseat
I imagine the tears in your eyes
The very first night I'll sleep without you
And when it happens I'll be miles away
And a few months late
Didn't know where I was running to
But I didn't look back

[Chorus]
And we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
So, for now, let's get away
On a Roman holiday

[Bridge]
Feet first, don't fall
Or we'll be running again
Keep close, stand tall
[Chorus]
'Cause we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now, let's get away

Strange Love Live from Webster Hall,pop,halsey,2020,667,"[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know
If we fucked on the bathroom sink

How we chain-smoked until three
And how you laughed when you said my name
And how you gripped my hips so mean

We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time

Put it deep beneath the track, like the hole you left in me
And everybody wants to know how it felt to hear you scream

Coming Down Live from Webster Hall,pop,halsey,2020,707,"[Verse 1]
I found God, I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake
I found the devil, found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerines
In his color-coded speak

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

[Chorus]
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this pricе
He's coming down, down, coming down
[Verse 2]
I found a martyr, he told me that I'd nеver
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs
I found a savior, I don't think he remembers
'Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine

[Pre-Chorus]
But now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

I've got a lover, a love like religion

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down

Every single time make a compromise

Oh, he's coming down, down, coming down

Keep on haunting
Keep on haunting me
Keep on haunting
Keep on haunting me

[Verse 1]
I was as pure as a river
But now I think I'm possessed
You put a fever inside me
And I've been cold since you left
I've got a boyfriend now and he's made of gold
And you've got your own mistakes in a bed at home
I'm hoping you could save me now, but you break and fold
You've got a fire inside, but your heart's so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've done some things that I can't speak
And I've tried to wash you away, but you just won't leave
So won't you take a breath and dive in deep?

Hands up!

Control Live from Webster Hall,pop,halsey,2020,892,"[Spoken Intro]
This is one of the most important songs I've ever written

[Verse 1]
They sent me away to find them a fortune
A chest filled with diamonds and gold
The house was awake with shadows and monsters
The hallways, they echoed and groaned
I sat alone, in bed 'til the morning
I'm crying, ""They're coming for me""
And I tried to hold these secrets inside me
My mind's like a deadly disease

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Chorus]
And all the kids cried out, ""Please stop, you're scaring me""
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
[Verse 2]
I paced around for hours on empty
I jumped at the slightest of sounds
And I couldn't stand the person inside me
I turned all the mirrors around

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Chorus]
And all the kids cried out, ""Please stop, you're scaring me""
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

[Bridge]
And I'm well acquainted with villains that live in my bed
They beg me to write them so they'll never die when I'm dead
And I've grown familiar with villains that live in my head
They beg me to write them so I'll never die when I'm dead
When I'm dead

I'm bigger than my body
And I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Verse 2]
White sheets, bright lights, crooked teeth, and the nightlife
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldn't let you complete me

[Chorus]
I'm trying not to let it show, that I don't want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
'Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutchеd my brain and eased my ailing

[Verse 3]
You're writing linеs about me, romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
'Cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain, but you're stuck in my brain
And all I do is cry and complain, because second's not the same
[Outro]
I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?
I'm sorry that I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?

Are sittin' and contemplating what to do with me, do with me
Think I took it way too far

And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?

Without me remix 2,pop,halsey,2021,67,"[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me Live without me

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine) I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Don't call me by my name
All of this is temporary
Watch as I slip away for your sake
All of this is temporary

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark
You won't even notice me depart
Secondhand thread in a secondhand bed
With a second man's head
Leavin' through the door without a word
You won't even notice, little bird
Better off dead, so I reckon I'm headed to Hell instead

Don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah

Jesus needed a three-day weekend
To sort out all his bullshit, figurе out the treason
I've been sеarching for a fortified defense
Four to five reasons
But Jesus, you've got better lips than Judas
I could keep your bed warm, otherwise, I'm useless
I don't really mean it 'cause who the fuck would choose this?

The Tradition,rock,halsey,2021,172148,"[Verse 1]
Oh, the loneliest girl in town
Is bought for pennies a price
We dress her up in lovely gowns
She's easy on the eyes
Her soul is black and it's a fact
That her sneer will eat you alive
And the buyer always brings her back
Because all she does is cry

[Chorus]
So take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness, never permission
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't givе a damn
It's in the blood and this is tradition
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh, the loneliеst girl in town
Was bought for plenty a price
Well, they dress her up in golden crowns
His smile hides a lie
She smiles back, but it's a fact
That her fear will eat her alive
Well, she got the life that she wanted
But now all she does is cry
[Chorus]
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness, never permission
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
It's in the blood and this is tradition

[Bridge]
You can't take it back, it's good as gone
Well, flesh amnesiac, this is your song
And I hope what's left will last all summer long
And they said that boys were boys, but they were wrong

[Chorus]
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness, never permission
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
It's in the blood and this is tradition
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn

Easier than Lying,rock,halsey,2021,176000,"[Verse 1]
I'm only whatever you make me
And you make me more and more a villain every day
But you don't know, you reap, you sow
Whatever you give to me, from yourself, you take
Well, if you're a hater, then hate the creator
It's in your image I'm made

[Chorus]
One eye open and one eye closed
'Cause I'll hang myself if you give me rope
I lost all my faith and lost all hope
That everything means anything at all
One eye broken and one eye bruised
'Cause I gave myself away for you
You liar, you don't love me too
It's easy for you after all

[Verse 2]
My heart is massive, but it's empty
A permanent part of me, that innocent artery
Is gaspin' for some real attention
Some undivided hypertension
Tell it, ""Quiet down, you're bein' loud""
But it beats harder every time you come around
But do you love the sound?

Well, I won't die for love
But I've got a body here to bury

She told me, ""Open your mouth,"" she said, ""I got a surprise""
And so I opened it wide and then she crawled inside
She's on the tip of my tongue, she's on the top of my thighs
And if I searched a thousand miles, I'd be dyin' to find

Between my fingers, she leaves, then she lingers
If she's gonna go, well, then I'm goin' with her
I know that I won't forget

She was sweet like honey
But all I can taste is the blood in my mouth
And the bitterness in goodbyе
Drippin' like honey
Down the back of my throat and on thе front of my mind
And well, she's impatient and I'm complacent
With just a little taste of wastin' time
Lookin' for honey
Well, she stings like she means it, she's mean and she's mine

Out and about without a reason or rhyme
And now she's dancin' on a table and she spins on a dime

Mm
""You do not""
""You do not""

[Verse 1]
It's the thing in your thighs when you're lonely at night
Scroll through your phone, gettin' high off the light
Numb in your chest when you close the blinds
Repose in time and you tell yourself you're fine, but you

[Chorus]
Sabotage the things you love the most
Camouflage so you can feed the lie that you're composed

[Verse 2]
This is the voice in your head that says, ""You do not want this""
This is the ache that says, ""You do not want him""
This is the glimmer of light that you're keepin' alive
When you tell yourself, ""Bet I could fuck him""
Why do you need love so badly?
Bet it's bеcause of her daddy
Bet shе was brutal and bratty
Bet that she'll never be happy
I bet that you're right and I'll show you in time, but I
[Chorus]
Sabotage the things I love the most
Camouflage so I can feed the lie that I'm composed

[Verse 3]
I've got a monster inside me that eats personality types
She's constantly changin' her mind on the daily
Think that she hates me, I'm feelin' it lately
Might have to trick her and treat her to
Seventy capsules or fly to a castle
So at least we could say that we died bein' traveled
Cultured and flattered and then I could trap her
But what does it matter?

[Verse 4]
""You do not want this""
This is the voice in your head that says, ""You do not want him""
This is that space in your bed that says, ""Bet I could fuck him""
Isn't it lonely?
These are the standards to which you could hold me
Think that you know me
You think that you could if you hold me
Think you could try to console me, but I do not know me
No, I do not know me
'Cause I, 'cause I
[Chorus]
Sabotage the things I love the most
Camouflage so I can feed the lie that I'm composed (""You do not want this"")
Sabotage the things I love the most (""You do not want this"")

The Lighthouse,rock,halsey,2021,114210,"[Verse 1]
From a tender age, I was cursed with rage
Came swingin' like a fist inside a battin' cage
I went swimmin' with the Devil at the bottom of a lake
And he left me there by my lonesome
He was tall and mean with venom eyes so green
Wanted reconciliation, but my tongue was in my teeth
I couldn't find the floor, so I was kickin' with my feet
But they weren't there, they were stolen

[Chorus]
There is a lighthouse
In thе middle of the deep
And I'm still stranded on thе shoreline there
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me, but they're make-believe
The lighthouse by the sea

[Verse 2]
I met a sailor on a ship with promise in his eyes
He kissed me on the mouth and dug his fingers in my thighs
But a sailor ain't a savior 'cause they only tell you lies
So I left him there 'til the sunrise
Well, the waves were tall and they were crashin' down
He's layin' in the water, begging God to let him drown
So I showed him all my teeth and then I laughed out loud
'Cause I never wanted savin', I just wanted to be found
[Chorus]
There is a lighthouse
In the middle of the deep
And I'm still stranded on the shoreline there
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me, but they're make-believe
The lighthouse by the sea

[Bridge]
Well, that should teach a man to mess with me
He was never seen again and I'm still wanderin' the beach
And I'm glad I met the Devil 'cause he showed me I was weak
And a little piece of him is in a little piece of me

[Chorus]
There is a lighthouse
In the middle of the deep
And I'm still stranded on the shoreline there
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me, but they're make-believe

Yaaburnee,rock,halsey,2021,141531,"[Verse 1]
I get undertones of sadness
When I think about the moments
That I never got to spend with you
I can't decide
If I love you more in morning
Or I love you more at night
With its luminous lux tides
Maybe in the daylight
All its pretty madness
And the complicated status
'Cause the moon don't pick sides
And the sun won't resign
Until you're by my side
Because the longing needs the leaving
And the loving needs the bleeding
And your beauty is a blessing
And I never got to tell you how
I lovе the way my eyes makе yours look green too

[Chorus]
I think we could live forever
In each other's faces 'cause I'll
Always see my youth in you
And if we don't live forever
Maybe one day, we'll trade places
Darling, you will bury me
Before I bury you
Before I bury you
[Verse 2]
I'll never know
If there's danger in confession
Or it's memory that presses
Like a blade against my throat
Another word and I could choke
But what's worse?
Tellin' you my feelings
Or to die without revealing
That you crawled inside my head
And set a fire there instead?
Letting all my insecurity
Devour me with certainty
That love is just a currency
So take my pockets, take me whole
Take my life and take my soul
Wrap me in a wedding ring
You know I swear I'd give you anything

Nightmare Reprise,rock,halsey,2022,10122,"[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a daggеr
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingеrs
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind

That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

That her sneer will eat you alive

Because all she does is cry

Girl is a Gun Live,pop,halsey,2021,140,"[Verse 1]
I feel lighter in the waistline
With no hands around me, no spit in my teeth
No, I'm not your daydream, I won't have your baby
Stop 'cause you're killin' my vibe
It's a shot in the dark, I'm not a walk in the park
I come loaded with the safety switched off
This girl is a gun and we've been havin' some fun
And I can show you if you turn the lights on

I keep waitin' for luck to come swallow me up
I feel better when the boys stop callin'
I keep fallin' in love, but this measuring cup
Is overflowin' with the same damn problems

And you'll be wishin' that you crossed your fingers
Oh, but God, is it fun when you can have more than one
So let me show you how to touch my trigger

Makin' me crazy from mornin' to evenin'
I cannot take it, I love it, I break it

And I can't be stressin' to give you attention
'Cause, oh, it's never enough, so I'm givin' you up

I don't know what you want from me
Well, I'm sunburnt lips and summer feet

Punch-wasted on redundancy

I spilled the milk you left for me
My tears are fallin' flawlessly now

You wished upon a falling star
And then left behind the avant-garde
For lemonade in crystal glasses
Picket fences, file taxes
Who the hell is in your bed?
You better kiss goodnight and give some head
And then next, the morning comes instead
Well, is this the life that lies ahead now?

Darling Live,pop,halsey,2021,161,"[Verse 1]
Really can't remember where I left my spine
Carryin' my body in a bag for dimes
Hidden in the pages of the New York Times at home
And maybe I'll be better if I take my meds
Ain't a doubleheader if you lose your head
Try the medication that I bought instead
It's workin' for a little, but there's not much left

Darling, don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
I'll see you in your drеams

Ever since a little girl, I found it sweet
Drivin' past a gravеyard on a lonesome street
All the little flowers gave me somethin' to believe in
Never knew the feelin' of a stable home
Been a couple years of livin' on the road
Couldn't really tell you where they'd leave a stone
To visit me when I am dead and gone

Darlin', don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
I'll see you in your dreams
Darlin', don't you cry
Head fast toward the light
Foolish men have tried
But only you have shown me how to love bein' alive

Until it's time to see the light
I'll make my own with you each night
I'll kidnap all the stars and I will keep them in your eyes
I'll wrap them up in velvet twine
And hang 'em from a fishin' line
So I can see them anytime I like

And if I searched a thousand miles, I'd be dyin' to find

Between my fingers, she leaves, then she lingers
If she's gonna go, well, then I'm goin' with her

With just a little taste of wastin' time

And now she's dancin' on a table and she spins on a dime

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in a mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces, then picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
Got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

On our way to the five-star
Remember seven minutes in heaven in the
In the back of your Mum's car
I guess we've come a long way
From spillin' our wish lists in the
In the margins of a news leaf
And it's been a long day
I'm checkin' the top floor
But it's not my name on the room key

Elevator doors open like curtains
And this is just one life-long performance
This might be the first time that you've heard this
Order room service, 'cause we deserve this

I didn't wake up to mints on my pillow case

Did you get what you came for?
You only get what you paid for
And what you tryna make a change for?
And is your life still the same bore?
Well did you get what you came for?
You only get what you paid for
And what you tryna make a change for?
And is your life still the same bore?

Thought that we'd be sippin' on the, ah, glamour
That they serve in the back room
But we're sippin' out of bottom shelf bottles that we've
That we've filled in the bathroom
Guess we've got a long way 'til we're signing our names in the
In the margins of a news leaf
Maybe one day to get the the top room
You can put my name on the room key

I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase
Maybe I could be a different human in a new place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
I just wanna feel somethin', tell me where to go
'Cause everybody knows somethin' I don't wanna know
So I stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone
Yeah, I'm better all alonе
But

[Chorus]
I am not a woman, I'm a god
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
So keep your hеart 'cause I already got one
I am not a woman, I'm a god
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
Keep your heart 'cause I already—
[Verse 2]
Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes
I never listen, but I see it with my eyes closed
I know you, I remember from the grass stain
Maybe I could be a better human with a new name

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
I just wanna feel somethin', tell me where to go

[Bridge]
I'm ready to leave it, I'll go when I feel it
Got caught, both hands on the smokin' gun
I try, but I need it, it's hard, but I feel it
And it really does hurt when you love someone
Oh

Don't wanna live as an untold story
Rather go out in a blaze of glory

Dodgin' bullets with your broken past

Sorry vowl.  HANZ Remix,pop,halsey,2018,23,"[Verse]
I've missed your calls for months it seems
Don't realize how mean I can be
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people that I love like jewelry
'Cause I can change my mind each day
I didn't mean to try you on
But I still know your birthday
And your mother's favorite song

[Chorus]
So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
I run away when things are good
And nеver really understood
Thе way you laid your eyes on me in ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again
I failed to see it from the start
And tore you open 'til the end
[Chorus]
And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

Someone will love you
Someone will love you

Without Me Remix Original,rap,halsey,2022,484,"[Verse 1: Halsey]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus: Halsey]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could livе without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm thе one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Halsey]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?

Live without me

It's you I cannot live without
Havin' lucid dreams now
What happens at my beach house
Stays at my beach house (Ah)
You walked in
Some residents of hell were layin' in our bed
You been away for so long, I'm lonely, I'm scared
But you are not there, I'm codependent
I had to fill in the void
