Cheap Ass Weave,rap,cardi b,2015,94369,"[Verse 1]
The nerve of you bitches
Like, oh my God, I got no words for you bitches
Like, who's really serving you bitches?
I need some answers, I'm worried for bitches
Like, this really absurd
No wonder these niggas stay curving you bitches
Don't even take no more selfies
That weave don't even deserve any pictures
Like, where did you buy that shit?
Who really acknowledged it?
What made you feel that you would be lit if you went and copped that shit?
They tell you ya look good?
Wasn't you iffy?
Oh, I know, they tell you that you get two bundles for fifty
Girl, you ain't low
I know how this go
Cheap shoes is okay, cheap dress is okay, but cheap weave is a ""no""
Don'tcha do it to yourself that's bad for your health
Don't fuck up your flow
Talk shit about me with ya dusty ass weave?
Now you outta control
I'm Cardi B, I come through and I kill everything, everything and that's a fact
Got me on my hitman shit like brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap
I'm fully reloaded, full clip
I cut to the chase, snip-snip
That weave gotta go, pink slip
Looking washed up, drip-drip
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?
(It's dead, bitch)
I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

[Chorus]
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
Don't even step to me if you got some cheap ass weave

[Verse 2]
So check yourself before you come at me
Cardi B killing shit, I'm causing casualties
I am a masterpiece, you are a tragedy
Finish you like Mortal Kombat; fatality
I got shit jumping like What a Time...
Like Jumpman, Jumpman
That weave you got should be a crime
You got no luck, man
And how you niggas even let them in the crib with that?
You know that weave stink, that shit need a Tic Tac
Now you tell me you pulling hair off your pillows, hair off the sheets, and even hair out your asscrack
So cheap weave is okay? I think I missed that
I see a track showing, you need to fix that
You got a braid loose, you need to twist that
You got it fucked up, I would never pick that
Lady Leshurr done told y'all to go brush your teeth
But after you done, you leave the crib with that cheap ass weave?
I'm begging Lord, oh God, oh God, oh please, oh please
Please just bless these thots, these thots with they cheap ass weave
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?
(It's dead, bitch)
I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

[Chorus]
Cheap ass weave

How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?

Stripper Hoe,rap,cardi b,2016,45957,"[Intro]
I'm your...

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm Cardi B with the wicked flow
Ask them, I keep them niggas on their tippy toes
Nick-nack-paddy-wack, give a dog a bone
Got him runnin' home, fuck him good, get that money flow
Pussy got him goin' places he would never go
Pussy got him cookin', now he wanna clean the stove
Pussy got him fucked up, I think he overdosed
But I ain't Travis Scott, I ain't got no antidote
Antidote, antidote

[Hook]
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that

[Verse 2]
Yo, some people know me as a stripper hoe
But stripper hoes get the money and blow digits though
A lot of bitches talkin' down on me like I'm a joke
Talk shit, I'll fuck your man, send him back hella broke
I'm laughin', but I really mean it though
I'm on another level like I'm playin' Mario
These bitches can't see me, even with a telescope
Every day I'm shittin' on 'em, I don't flush the toilet bowl
Ew! Cause I be workin' and workin'
All these heads I be turnin', they on my body like surgeons
I think they see my conversion
That's why they be lurkin', but their feelings be hurtin'
Or remember when I wanna dance at certain clubs
And they told me, ""No, no, that's a dub""
Now they the same niggas blowin' up my phone
Wantin' me to host, oh word? That's a dub

[Hook]
I think I like that
(I know, I know they're mad now)
I think I like that
I think I like that
(Hurtin' my feelings)
I think I like that

[Verse 3]
When I come up in the building I initiate
I'm the reason why the fuckers gotta renovate
I'm eatin' good and they mad they can't get a plate
Never thought we'd be gettin' booked in different states
Before the century they didn't even look this way
Now they wanna eat my ass like a skirt steak
Got 'em sending gifts, it's not even my birthday
You niggas soft and I meant that in the worst way
Oh you bitches suckin' dick just to get a bag
You hustlin'-backwards ass bitch, you're doin' bad
It's pretty sad, you should be getting more than that
Suck a dick so you can pay your rent, couple months with that
I mention flow, keep it on the low, I tell you facts
When a nigga 'bout to cum, just throw it back
It's over, you won, that nigga trapped
And that bank account, girl? Empty that",en,"i'm your . . .  yo , i'm cardi b with the wicked flow ask them , i keep them niggas on their tippy toes nick-nack-paddy-wack , give a dog a bone got him runnin' home , fuck him good , get that money flow pussy got him goin' places he would never go pussy got him cookin' , now he wanna clean the stove pussy got him fucked up , i think he overdosed but i ain't travis scott , i ain't got no antidote antidote , antidote  i think i like that i think i like that i think i like that i think i like that  yo , some people know me as a stripper hoe but stripper hoes get the money and blow digits though a lot of bitches talkin' down on me like i'm a joke talk shit , i'll fuck your man , send him back hella broke i'm laughin' , but i really mean it though i'm on another level like i'm playin' mario these bitches can't see me , even with a telescope every day i'm shittin' on 'em , i don't flush the toilet bowl ew ! cause i be workin' and workin' all these heads i be turnin' , they on my body like surgeons i think they see my conversion that's why they be lurkin' , but their feelings be hurtin' or remember when i wanna dance at certain clubs and they told me , ""no , no , that's a dub"" now they the same niggas blowin' up my phone wantin' me to host , oh word ? that's a dub bands  i think i like that  i think i like that i think i like that  i think i like that  when i come up in the building i initiate i'm the reason why the fuckers gotta renovate i'm eatin' good and they mad they can't get a plate never thought we'd be gettin' booked in different states before the century they didn't even look this way now they wanna eat my ass like a skirt steak got 'em sending gifts , it's not even my birthday you niggas soft and i meant that in the worst way oh you bitches suckin' dick just to get a bag you hustlin'-backwards ass bitch , you're doin' bad it's pretty sad , you should be getting more than that suck a dick so you can pay your rent , couple months with that i mention flow , keep it on the low , i tell you facts when a nigga 'bout to cum , just throw it back it's over , you won , that nigga trapped and that bank account , girl ? empty that","['yo', 'cardi', 'b', 'wicked', 'flow', 'ask', 'niggas', 'tippy', 'toes', 'nick', 'nack', 'paddy', 'wack', 'dog', 'bone', 'got', 'runnin', 'home', 'fuck', 'good', 'money', 'flow', 'pussy', 'got', 'places', 'pussy', 'got', 'cookin', 'wanna', 'clean', 'stove', 'pussy', 'got', 'fucked', 'think', 'overdosed', 'ai', 'travis', 'scott', 'ai', 'got', 'antidote', 'antidote', 'antidote', 'think', 'like', 'think', 'like', 'think', 'like', 'think', 'like', 'yo', 'people', 'know', 'stripper', 'hoe', 'stripper', 'hoes', 'money', 'blow', 'digits', 'lot', 'bitches', 'talkin', 'like', 'joke', 'talk', 'shit', 'fuck', 'man', 'send', 'hella', 'broke', 'laughin', 'mean', 'level', 'like', 'playin', 'mario', 'bitches', 'telescope', 'day', 'shittin', 'flush', 'toilet', 'bowl', 'ew', 'cause', 'workin', 'workin', 'heads', 'turnin', 'body', 'like', 'surgeons', 'think', 'conversion', 'lurkin', 'feelings', 'hurtin', 'remember', 'wanna', 'dance', 'certain', 'clubs', 'told', 'dub', 'niggas', 'blowin', 'phone', 'wantin', 'host', 'oh', 'word', 'dub', 'bands', 'think', 'like', 'think', 'like', 'think', 'like', 'think', 'like', 'come', 'building', 'initiate', 'reason', 'fuckers', 'got', 'ta', 'renovate', 'eatin', 'good', 'mad', 'plate', 'thought', 'gettin', 'booked', 'different', 'states', 'century', 'look', 'way', 'wanna', 'eat', 'ass', 'like', 'skirt', 'steak', 'got', 'sending', 'gifts', 'birthday', 'niggas', 'soft', 'meant', 'worst', 'way', 'oh', 'bitches', 'suckin', 'dick', 'bag', 'ass', 'bitch', 'bad', 'pretty', 'sad', 'getting', 'suck', 'dick', 'pay', 'rent', 'couple', 'months', 'mention', 'flow', 'low', 'tell', 'facts', 'nigga', 'cum', 'throw', 'won', 'nigga', 'trapped', 'bank', 'account', 'girl']",8,Social Commentary
Trust Issues,rap,cardi b,2016,63100,"[Chorus]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back, that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold
Middle finger up to you hoes
Hating on me, I'm making moves on the road though
And I don't really trust them no more
I don't really stress it no more
I don't be trusting them, I don't be trusting them
I don't be stressing them, I don't be stressing them
I swear I just flex on them, I swear I just flex on them
I swear I just flex on them, I swear I just flex on them

Carbi B, me, bad one
You bitches, sad ones
I just get my money and I style on them
All them bitches broke and they mad I just dab on them
Wave bye, hit the gas on them
200 on the dash on them
I don't say much, I just swag on them
I be killin' them, I go Fab on them
Left right, throwing jabs at them
Night night, I'ma black on them
Hit the game raw, no Magnums
Can't stop winning, God, finna go platinum

So if you don't it's probably cause you broke or you ugly
Every time that I'm on the road—popping
Every time that I do a show—popping
When I put this pussy on the pole—popping
Friends want to have these cornrows—popping

I need all my money makers bring that cash out
I need all my D boys to bring that cash out
I need all my scammer niggas bring that cash out
Don't you see these big ass titties and this ass out?

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me, I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me, we gon' beef forever
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me, I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me, we gon' beef forever

[Verse 1]
W—W—Why you always tryna run and hide? (Why?)
Always have my name up in your mouth, you outta line
You gon' make me pop up at your door like ""surprise"" (Hi)
Like ""come outside, lil' bitch, come outside""
Never by my lonely, got my niggas by my side
And all my niggas skrr skrr, yeah, they down to ride
Yeah, my bitches go to work; I'm talking 9 to 5 (Work)
The streets want to fuck around you won't stay alive
Your mouth can cost you, and I’ll make sure that you pay the price
So don't be lackin' when you comin' home from work at night
You run your mouth; I'm poppin' out, now it's on sight
You—You—You gon' be just like my pussy: hella tight
A ho can hate, but don't be fucking with my commas (No)
And if she is, I'll shape her up and she gon' get the line up
Can't be starting all these problems if you cannot solve 'em (Don't do that)
Cardi backing down, I swear to God, that's not an option

[Verse 2]
Some bitches claim they with the shit, but they ain't with a thing
I spin the block, come around like a boomerang
Silence, silence, I don't hear a thing
Worry 'bout me, but your pussy smell like turtle tank
I pull up on that check, nothing less, that's all I do
T—T—Ten bands, fifty bands, ain't nuttin' new
I see some people who still worried 'bout my revenue (Why you worry?)
I'm eating good, you wish you could, don't worry about my food
And niggas hating on a female, ain't no way to live (Lil bitch)
You bitch-made, make me wonder if you got a dick (Lil bitch)
How you feeling like a man envying a chick? (Pussy)
Wake up and go get some money, go and find your niche (Get that money)
Silly motherfucker (Silly,) who raised you? (Who raised you?)
A nigga with a pussy? How disgraceful (Oh my God)
I have my hitters come, and duct tape you
And your bitch could get it too, double date, boo
So let's get it, so let's get it, so let's get it
Let's not waste a minute; you clearly started, so let's finish
I don't do forgiveness; they take your kindness for a gimmick
I'm just here for business, I'm running down and I'm with it, bap

Always talking about what you got so what you got
Always talking about you run that block nigga really what block
Always talking about your shooters ha, so who y'all shot?
Always talking about your foreign whips nigga, really what lot?
Always talking about y'all niggas scam okay you scam
But your bank account got 0 dollars, so what's the plan?
Boy you lying using hella filters this ain't the gram
Boy I'm hot I use you to cool me down nigga use the fan

[Chorus]
I dont do no sauce niggas (lil bitch)
Pop a pill I abort niggas (lil bitch)
And I don't save them I export niggas (lil bitch)
You niggas ass salad tossed niggas (lil bitch)

Some of you niggas is really too soft
I do y'all like frisbees you niggas get tossed
Always emotional blinging my line go find Nemo and nigga get lost
Cannot talk spicy cause you are not hot
You are just sauce
You bought me a chain, a ring, and a watch but how much it cost

Everything,rap,cardi b,2016,20950,"[Intro]
You know, people underestimated me
And making me feel like I'm never gonna amount to shit because I used to be a stripper
It feels like I'm getting whipped in the back, with words
But you know what?
They don't see the bigger picture
I had to feed myself, I had to feed my family
But you know what?
Just here me out

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive me for my sins
Forgive me for the crazy shit I wish I never did
I'm simply just a young hood girl tryna win
I just want it all, and I gon' pretend
Like I ain't never had to suck a dick to pay my rent
I'm tryna get my family out the hood and new cribs
I wanna finish paying my mothers new whip
I do it for a cause, so understand the kid
I want my little girl to go to school in Fort Lee
Schools in the hood, got him crazy, man he three
And it's fucked that it ain't how it's supposed to be
He should be counting 123's and ABC's
And momma used to beat my ass like every week
That's because she can't have nothing but love for me
I wanna spoil her so much, oh lord please
That's my everything
My everything, my family
[Hook]
You know what?
Even when I was stripping, like bitches was worried 'bout the wrong things
Oh they want red bottoms, they want the biggest cars
Like I'm worried 'bout my father stop cab driving
Before he turn sixty, and my mom stop being a cashier before she fifty like
That's why I'm working so hard out here
That's why I go so hard
Not for me, but for them though
You feel me?

[Verse 2]
Note to self, for my sister Hennessy
Try and go to school, finish up and get degrees
Don't be fucking trick niggas, just so you can eat
That's the shit I did and it really makes me weak
I would close my eyes, dying for it to be over
The thought of a stranger inside, I just can't be sober
Dirty ass breath, breathing all over my shoulders
Ain't no bitch gon' tell you that, just respect the soldier
And I wanna tell my dad, you don't gotta cab
Drive for two whole weeks just to make a stack
You don't gotta drive no more, I'm gon' change all that
I put that on my everything, I'm gon' pray for that

[Outro]
You know when I was a little girl I used to tell my mom
""Hey mom, when I grow up, I'm gonna buy you a house, I'm gonna buy you a car""
Until I turned eighteen, it's like damn, I can't even get me my own apartment
So, it's just like, now that I'm in this position I'm gonna
I'm gonna take full advantage of it
Like oh my gosh, I can't wait till I get to surprise my mom
Like, ""Hey, I didn't went to college, but look, look at me mom, look at me now, look, look mom, look, look at your house, This is your house! Not mines, but yours, and I bough it for you!""",en,"you know , people underestimated me and making me feel like i'm never gonna amount to shit because i used to be a stripper it feels like i'm getting whipped in the back , with words but you know what ? they don't see the bigger picture i had to feed myself , i had to feed my family but you know what ? just here me out  lord forgive me for my sins forgive me for the crazy shit i wish i never did i'm simply just a young hood girl tryna win i just want it all , and i gon' pretend like i ain't never had to suck a dick to pay my rent i'm tryna get my family out the hood and new cribs i wanna finish paying my mothers new whip i do it for a cause , so understand the kid i want my little girl to go to school in fort lee schools in the hood , got him crazy , man he three and it's fucked that it ain't how it's supposed to be he should be counting 123's and abc's and momma used to beat my ass like every week that's because she can't have nothing but love for me i wanna spoil her so much , oh lord please that's my everything my everything , my family  you know what ? even when i was stripping , like bitches was worried 'bout the wrong things oh they want red bottoms , they want the biggest cars like i'm worried 'bout my father stop cab driving before he turn sixty , and my mom stop being a cashier before she fifty like that's why i'm working so hard out here that's why i go so hard not for me , but for them though you feel me ?  note to self , for my sister hennessy try and go to school , finish up and get degrees don't be fucking trick niggas , just so you can eat that's the shit i did and it really makes me weak i would close my eyes , dying for it to be over the thought of a stranger inside , i just can't be sober dirty ass breath , breathing all over my shoulders ain't no bitch gon' tell you that , just respect the soldier and i wanna tell my dad , you don't gotta cab drive for two whole weeks just to make a stack you don't gotta drive no more , i'm gon' change all that i put that on my everything , i'm gon' pray for that  you know when i was a little girl i used to tell my mom ""hey mom , when i grow up , i'm gonna buy you a house , i'm gonna buy you a car"" until i turned eighteen , it's like damn , i can't even get me my own apartment so , it's just like , now that i'm in this position i'm gonna i'm gonna take full advantage of it like oh my gosh , i can't wait till i get to surprise my mom like , ""hey , i didn't went to college , but look , look at me mom , look at me now , look , look mom , look , look at your house , this is your house ! not mines , but yours , and i bough it for you !

My mom couldn't take me at the time, so she had to kick me out
But I'm not mad at her one bit, cause I don't think I would've took this route
I had to go get it on my own
Im just glad I figured it out
Like I been through a lot
And it wasn't easy to escape
That's why it really bothers me when motherfuckers got something to say
And just to set the record straight
[?] to stop a J

I swear they be wanting so much credit
But don't wanna give none when it's due
Slept on ya girl for so long
Now wanna come hopping out the blue
Nah bruh shit don't work like that
Well at least it don't in my book
Cause if you fuck with me hard, and I fuck with you, then there's no other way to look

Oh, how you doin'?
I'm alright
Hahaha

[Verse]
Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore you get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels, throwin' deals from left to right
But I ain't givin' in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happen overnight
All that flexin' they be doin', shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hatin' bitch talkin' shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm suckin' dick
So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fuckin' lit
And don't be talkin' all that sorry shit, don't flip the script
I see the lights, I hear the hype, I hit the mic
I kill the show, I get my dough, I catch a flight
I see a hater, I'm runnin' down, it's on sight
I throw my hands, I hit em' left, I hit em' right
They sleepin' on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good 'cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowin' up my phone, sayin' everythin' I touch is lit
Actin' corn and wanna fuck me like they wasn't talkin' shit, whoa
I let 'em live, let the shady motherfuckers live
Get them the price then it's time to show them what it is
Don't got the bat? Well then, what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time, I ain't never been no average bitch
Not to mention, I did my tour and that shit was winnin'
Independent, the headline, award of feelin'
I thank the Lord for every blessing that he has given
I love the fans, they fill me up with their ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up? Look exhausted
Wave the white flag, girl, you might as well just forfeit
My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
Lookie, lookie now, lookie now, nigga, I'm that bitch
What you thought? Yeah, you really lost, now you kinda sick
But I ain't never need a nigga, I was always on my shit, yeah
I used to stare at magazines on the train
Lookin' at these models like, ""I gotta be this one day""
Fuck around, got myself a name, now I'm gettin' paid

Don't let me catch a bitch, you wanna chance that shit?
You should just dead it

Watch when I start askin' you:
Why the fuck you take so long to answer my message?
The fuck you gon' tell me?
Oh, you with the homies?
Don't even think you can curve me for some other pussy
'Cause it can get ugly

And I will blow all them bitches that's all in ya DMs

Lookin' like I caught a lick
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Verse 1]
Look at me, look at me
They ain't like me before, now they bookin' me
The glow got bitches so shook at me
They like, ""Chef Cardi B, what you cookin' B?""
I say, ""Bitches, got me on some new shit""
I swear niggas got me feelin' ruthless
Too much mo'fuckers done doubted me
That's why I had to just prove it
I remember walkin' in the stores, I couldn't buy nothin'
They look at me starin'
Now I just walk in the stores, I like it I cop it
I don't even think
Bank tellers asking for info
'Cause now my deposits on Kimbo
Told that bitch, ""Gimme my money
Why the fuck you askin' all this info?""

Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grindin' all night
Didn't sleep 'til the sun up

Walk around like I'm that bitch

[Verse 2]
See me in my 'bach, now they all surprised
Now they call my phone, I just press decline
Not even six seconds, I don't give 'em Vine
Tell 'em, ""Fall back,"" all must recline
Bitches mad as fuck but I don't give a fuck
Niggas can't believe it, better soak it up
Lookin' like I caught a lick, bitch
Your nigga got me on his wishlist
Thought I was makin' no moves?
Thought I was gon' be livin' in Sues?
Thought I was makin' no money?
You fuckin' thought I was gon' lose
Everythin' I did, I swear I got paid
Been 'bout my money, that ain't gon' change
Bitch, you gon' drown tryna ride on my wave
Corny ass bitches, I just can't relate

Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up

I see the pain in your eyes
And truth is, only the strong survive
And you still here, so from here you only gon' rise
Spread them wings so they can tell you how far you gonna fly
You don't gotta pop them pills
I know just how you feel
I know there's a lot of fake love
But there's love that's actually real
But that can't stop you now
You're already on the battle field
Took everythin' that came your way
Almost at the top of the hill, fly, baby, fly

[Hook: Josh X]
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up
[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Don't be so quick to just give in
If you give up now, how you gon' win?
I know them stressful nights made you and the pills best friends
I know it feels good, but this shit just got to end
I'm countin' on you, boo
Put this peer pressure on you
If I overcame that shit
I know you can make it too
I don't want to see you lose
There's other ways to heal that bruise
I know you can make it to see
What's at the end of the solution, shine, baby, shine

It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up

[Bridge: Cardi B]
Don't jump now
I come for you
I'm here for you

They don't like my growth, well fuck ya hoes
Yeah, 'cause all my bitches that be gettin' with me
If I put a fifty, they gon' put a fifty
Every night, ask Sue's rendezvous
It was Kita, Sweetness, and Ashanti with me
I had to go get it on some real shit
If you a real bitch ,you gon' feel this
Every single nigga that came my way
I finesse and juug on some ill shit
So much people think they know my pussy
But no one can say they fucked
Please show me hoe facts
Name-drop, round 'em up
That bum bitch like to run her mouth
I swear to God I'ma lay her out
When I catch you on the side of town
My Guiseppe heels gonna stomp you out
I'm tired of playin', I'm tired of playin'
I'ma give you hell, you gon' think I'm Satan
I see you mad 'cause I'm 'bout to have this whole shit on lock
Incarceration
Someone gave you wrong information
You try to play me, that's confirmation

Why you actin' like I won't leave you down in the ground?

Get that money then I go flip

If that was true I wouldn't have shit, yeah
Bronx bitch 'til the day I die
I did my dirt and I ain't gotta lie
You can talk crazy on IG
But when I run up, let them hands fly
I don't fuck around with no fuckin' clowns
Any niggas with me, they fuckin' hounds
Any bitches with me, they fuckin' down
So if you really 'bout it, then pull up now

Y'all like my god brothers and my god sisters
I would dead jump in your fight, I would dead jump in your fight
Now what's poppin?

Baby mama's mad 'cause I'm in first place, and
When it comes to you bitch, there's no conversation
I been to give it up grimy, I'm the Bronx bitch, I'm feisty
""Cardi why you feisty?"" Shut up bitch, fight me
NY raised and so you know it's very likely
That when I hear some shit that I don't like, I get hype B
Who would wanna wife me? Your nigga wanna wife me
You think 'cause I'm a stripper hoe, that nigga won't think twice B?
Put this pussy on his face, ride that shit nicely
Set his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me
So what you tryna do? You and you and you
I feel some type a way, a bitch finna get loose
Tell me what's the deal? I'm 'bout to start the hill
The wig is comin' off, shit 'bout to get real

Oh you shinin'? Your chain and your watch is off
You was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off
Youse a pussy, and your whole block is soft
You caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off
You thought that bag was gettin' you pussy, not at all
You was gettin' lied, you ain't know she made that call
To the dog's dinner, and they starvin'
I gotta feed all 'em
I'maget that nigga, you gon' get that bitch

Nah, we on the same time
You got yours, I got mine

Superman calves, and her shoulder somethin' retarded
I ain't backin' down, Cardi got the heart regardless
You gon' have to knock me out if you think I'ma forfeit
Gang gang, squad up, and have my niggas all on it
Pay a couple niggas and they had you out in a coffin
And I put that on my life, I really don't do this often
But the way I'm feelin' now, like whatever, I'm on it
Have you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off
Had the pastor prayin', like, ""Sorry for your, loss""
Throw dirt on my name, you better pop off
My name ring bells like Mayweather, box off

KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill
[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott
[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look

Put this pussy on wax, took me straight to the tip top

Next bitch in my face catchin' case, catchin' case
But anywho, anywho, Birkin bag, Jimmy Choos
All my bitches say ""Eeeeooowwww!"", all my guns go ""Boom!""
More guns than the warden, smack hoes with my Jordans

How I Do,rap,cardi b,2017,23508,"[Intro]
Gangsta !
Cardi !
B !

[Chorus]
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

[Verse 1]
Pull up like huh?
They looking like what?
Heads turn left and right, they wonder who's her?
Cardi B, duh
Bitch don't front
You on my Gram all day, don't play dumb
Came up from the slums
The dirty, dirty Bronx
Where niggas quick to clip your shit, no fair ones
You gotta keep a gun, but beef to me is fun
I never back down, been this way since day one
[Pre-Chorus]
They shit on me before, thought I was just a stupid hoe
They tight now, they realize they was sleeping on gold
Took me one year man, and now I'm doin' shows
Now they wanna take pics with me, hold on let me pose
Believe me, I easily can do a bitch greasy
I'll give it to you just how you like it girlll
Cardi B in full effect, couple bitches upset
Couple niggas wanna hit it and they can't so they stressed

[Chorus]
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

[Verse 2]
Cardi in tune, bitches make room
Test me? The gat goes CLICK, CLACK, BOOM
Gangsta Bitch, oooh, Volume 2
Cop somethin' mean, when it start you hear that VROOM
Pull up to your side, 30 deep right?
Stuntin' on my ex, he thirsty for a reply
Sick, sick, sick
Call my phone, it's CLICK
Had me fucked up when you was fucking with that bitch
[Pre-Chorus]
Making power moves
Goin' 50 on 'em
Same ones that played me
High-siddity on 'em
Back to back with it, goin' Drizzy on 'em
Now they tight, they gotta watch me make a milli on 'em

[Chorus]
I do the Maybach on Monday, Ferrari Friday
This is sweet pussy Saturday, that's just what Plies say
I said ""Bae, it's a snack,"" he said it's an entrée
With them pretty ass twins, you look like Beyoncé
Lookin' like money bag, money bag, money bag, uh

And my bitches with me pretty, too, they look like bridesmaids
And they all Bloody Gang, so don't be talkin' sideways
[Verse 1]
He said I'm protein thick, you look like a dope fiend, sis
He make sure he put Cardi down on his grocery list
Now why this bitch tryna look on my Snap?
I take your man and I won't give him back
I just walk into the booth and attack
I hit this grind, the roof gon' collapse
I been broke my whole life, I have no clue what to do with these racks
Wig be laid, waist snatched, ass fat, straight facts
Got lips like Angelina, Bentley truck tangerine, unh
Tramps jumpin' on my dick, that's why they call it trampoline, uh

Always talkin' in the background, don't never come to the podium
Chef Cardi B, I'm cookin' up, I see you hoes at the stove again
While you hoes were sleepin' on me, I made 40 bands by 4pm
They be taking shots, miss miss, X and O, kiss kiss

I ain't worried 'bout her, that's an old ho
You thought I was comin' with my old flow
Kodak ain't com to take no photo
I don't even pull up in a four door
I just hit a lick, hit the load though
All my life smokin' on JoJo
He was just posted up with dough though
Now he gettin' slammed by the popo
Thuggish, buggish, ruggish shit
I can't leave the streets, I love this shit
Never gave a shit 'bout a messy bitch
I ain't never take a risk for a petty lick
I'm at Digital Heights and I'm goin' on a heist
Dead presidents, John Kennedy
Dead presidents, pockets Mount Everest
When I step on the scene it's a felony (yeah, yeah)
Christian Louboutin (yeah)
These ain't Louis Vuittons (huh)
Hit a Kodak Bop on nae nae
I wanna top me a Nae Nae
Now I'm in a white whip, no mayonnaise
Stole a new car for me, Audi A8
Cardi B brought the beat, told me re-rock the heat
Try me, I'll do the race like I'm Tay-K
It ain't no flockin' over here, lil' buddy
All of us zombies over here, lil' buddy
All of us robbin' 'cause they love your money
Got our own money, but we love your money
Crack a nigga's head wide open like a pumpkin
Jaguar F-Type orange like a pumpkin
Young nigga, I got old hundreds
Smokin' K2 with my bunkie (woo!)

Get Up 10,rap,cardi b,2018,758629,"[Verse]
Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (Bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (Yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (Facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (Hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (Say it)
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (Huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (Skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (Facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (Huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (No)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (Cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced (Laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (Fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (Fucked up shit)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this (Woo)
I walked into the label, ""Where the check at?"" (""Where the check?"")
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (Bad ass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (Try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that ""blap"" sound (Blap!)
[Chorus]
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (Woo)

[Bridge]
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (Yeah)
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (Ah)
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (Grrr)
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (Grrr)

Drop it down, fuck around, I might hurt niggas
Booty so big that it swallow up panties
Same with these hoes, swallow up the Xanny

Booty on the track, fuck around and win a Grammy
They call me Cardi, code red, lightskinned, bone legged
Tell him throw more bread, I put it on his forehead

Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga
[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Big boy tools, Maaco (Big boy)
Make a bitch dance with a Draco (Dance)
Walkin' with the cheese, that queso (Cheese)
That's Huncho, fuck the Rodeo (Huncho)
Private jet, we don't do layover (Whew)
One call, I'm havin' your bae over (Brrt)
Walk out the spot with a makeover (Woo)
Got her addicted to payola (Addicted, hey)

(Alright-alright, alright, alright, alright, alright)
From across the globe, look, uh

[Verse 1]
Now, I said luxury apartments (Wow)
I'm young and I'm heartless (Yeah)
There's a bitch there in my vision that bitch is a target (Brrr)
Lawyer is a Jew, he gon' chew up all the charges
Don't matter if you fuck with me, I get money regardless (cash)

Get some money, ho, tell me why you stressed
[Verse 2]
Now I said, hoes down, Gs up (Gs up)
You know how I'm rockin', but my watch is freezed up (Ice!)
I can't wait until they drop that Lamborghini truck (Skrrt!)
I'm careful where I park it, hoes will have it keyed up
Them bitches getting beat up (Blatt)
Slim waist, ass fat (Fat), my shit is caked up
My bad bitch at the bank (Yeah), without no makeup
This that collard greens, cornbread, neck bone, back fat
Get it from my mama and you don't know where your daddy at
Knick-knack, paddywhack, give a dog a bone (Bone)
Put it on him, then your nigga never comin' home (Home)
I'ma flex like a 'roid, I'm a ten, she a 'droid
Stupid ho, unimportant, unattractive, unemployed

Now with me it's only facts (Boy, please, whatever)
Expensive weave, and my checks is worth some racks, ugh
[Verse 3]
Yeah, pop that pussy like you ain't popped that pussy in a while
Pop that pussy like poppin' pussy is goin' out of style
Pop that pussy while you work, pop that pussy up at church
Pop that pussy on the pole, pop that pussy on the stove
Make that pussy slip and slide, like you from the 305
Put your tongue out in the mirror, pop that pussy while you drive
Spread them asscheeks open, make that pussy crack a smile
Lock your legs 'round that nigga, make him give your ass a child (woo)
Gimme some neck, gimme a check
Pussy so good, make a nigga invest
Get a little spit, I'm gettin' it wet
I'll get it back up, just give me a sec'
Give him some vag', I'm gettin' a bag
Give him some ass, I'm gettin' some Raf
When I'm done, I make him cum, but then, he comin' off that cash

[Chorus]
Get you some guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Said I'm livin' my best life
Said I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like ""skrrt""
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like ""skrrt""
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli (Yeah)
You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready (Woo)
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (Huh)
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (Yeah)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, ""You made for this""
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
""#CardiBIsSoProblematic"" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash
I'm gigglin', can't let the devil have the last laugh
Ain't no more beefin', I'm just keepin' to myself
I'm my own competition, I'm competin' with myself (Brrr)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You don't like money, I can see it your eye
You don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie
Better be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly (Sheesh)
She count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night
But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike
God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life (Woo)
And that guala like Iyanla 'cause that bag just fixed my life (Woo, woo)
And y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne (Woo)
But can we please get some more champagne? (Ugh)
Please, no Andre, G like 'Venchy
Reach like 'Bron James, pep talk from Yoncé
'Member my hands had ash like Pompeii

I said I never had a problem showin' y'all the real me
Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy
Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy

Thru Your Phone,rap,cardi b,2018,884653,"[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Look, I just want to break up all your shit
Call your mama phone, let her know that she raised a bitch
Then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake-ass friends
Comin' round actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram? Lil' bitch
I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feelin', it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

My heart is beating like it's bleedin' out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleepin' like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyoncé on my stereo, ""Resentment"" on repeat
I'ma make you a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, ""Here you go, nigga, bon appétit""
Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a ho from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no bad bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, ""Why you got an attitude?""

Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex (Yeah)
I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it (Yeah)
Gucci shoes and a belt like it (Woo)
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ayy, these heels are Givenchy, ho
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ayy
For the record, I set record record sales (Huh?)
I like niggas that been in and outta jail (Huh?)

Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest (Brrt)
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spend what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through (Woo)

And you can tell your little _____
'I screenshotted all your naked pics'
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Break up and see your boobs on 'The Gram'?

Performed live on TV, I hid you under my dress
We did the ruffles, the fur coats a hundred different ways
But seems like you getting larger every day
I'm overwhelmed, the pressure startin' to swell
The time to turn in my album is winding down
So I locked in, started workin', I was driven
Hearing public opinions about my private decisions
And that right there, see, love to drive you crazy
Complete strangers talkin' 'bout my baby
Comin' from people that never used to check for me
They wrote opinions but nothin' off the registry

And I don't save them I export niggas (lil bitch)
You niggas ass salad tossed niggas (lil bitch)

[Verse 1]
Always talking about what you got so what you got
Always talking about you run that block nigga really what block
Always talking about your shooters ha, so who y'all shot?
Always talking about your foreign whips nigga, really what lot?
Always talking about y'all niggas scam okay you scam
But your bank account got 0 dollars, so what's the plan?
Boy you lying using hella filters this ain't the gram
Boy I'm hot I use you to cool me down nigga use the fan

Some of you niggas is really too soft
I do y'all like frisbees you niggas get tossed
Always emotional blinging my line go find Nemo and nigga get lost
Cannot talk spicy cause you are not hot
You are just sauce
You bought me a chain, a ring, and a watch but how much it cost
It's not expensive then he is a not I'm cutting him off
They be like Cardi why you so cold nigga I don't defrost
And I mean it y'all fiending why you scheming
You sauce you false won't comment I red beam him

Lost friends on the way, this shit is breakin' my heart

Holdin' my Grammy, rubbin' my clit

Whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house (Hol' up)
I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

[Verse 1: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo
[Verse 4: Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

Why me? Did I do y’all wrong?
No, y’all just ungrateful and heartless

I don't sin, I don't curse
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Amen!)
[Verse 2:  Sister Megan Thee Stallion]
Pray with me, worship with me, light a candle (Yeah)
Quick, jump out before you get in the sin inside of me (Yeah)
I tell the Priest, where to put the Bible, always tell him where you're going to be (amen)
I'll run down the alter before Satan runs after me (hey, hey, hey!)
Talk your words of prayer, get no layers (Yeah)
Ask for a hearse while you transport the dead (transport the dead)
You really aren't going to sin for his prayer (Aye)
Father already made his mind up before he arrived (aye, aye)
Now get your cassock and cape for this worship and prayer (aye, aye, amen)
He bought a Bible just for this worship and prayer (aye, aye, amen)
Paid my tuition just to pray for the Lord and Saviour (Jesus Christ)

[Verse 3: Mother Cardi + Sister Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, we don't need adultery, don't need facism
Need a Bible, need a Priest
Don't need sin, I need purity
With the Old Testament in it, hope it preaches out loud
He got some red wine, then that's when I'm needed
Wagyu A1 just like his bread
He got a bible, well, I'm tryna pray for it
I let him pray, now he holy
I don't wanna spit, I wanna pray
I wanna worship, I wanna pray
I want you to pray against the sins of your family and yourself
My recital game is pure, Holy Water
It's going in sinful and it's coming out holy
I rebuke on his sin and now he tryna sign me, amen
[Verse 4: Sister Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I'm a Priest, Templar Sword, Holy Bible
Switch my sin, make him feel like he preachin'
Put him on his knees, give him something to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a Father (Amen)
In the religious ranks, I'm the one preaching for you
If he ate my bread, he's a blood drinker (red wine)
Big B stands for big Bible
I could make you preach before I ever baptise you
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like the preaching
If he prays for me and ask ""Who is it?""
When I ride that hearse, I'm going to say his name

[Chorus: Mother Cardi]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you preaching with some worship and prayer
Bring a Bible and a rosary for this worship and prayer
Give me everything you got for this worship and prayer
Now from the top, Jesus drops, that's some worship and prayer
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some worship and prayer
Bread and wine on a plate, that's some worship and prayer

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the, they can't mess with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' kid, you can't mess with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't mess with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now shе say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know wherе I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a care 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What kid working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals, ""I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these be mad at me, their baby father run a bill
[Chorus]
Said lil' kid, you can't mess with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't mess with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a , you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this is hot like a stove
My glitter is gold, tell that lil' play her role
I just arrive in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these girls know, just in case these forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house

I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet and gushy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you dealin' with some wet, wet, wet
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet, wet, wet
Give me everything you got for this wet, wet, wet

[Verse 1: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Beat it up, baby, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this cookie right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel, I'm kinda wild
Look at my mouth, look at my thighs
This water is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make me dream, make a stream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a (Ayy) runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your sh–, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that (Ah) (While you ride that)
You really ain't never gotta (Mwah) him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this  wet, wet, wet (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this  wet, wet, wet
Pay my tuition just to kiss me on this  wet, wet, wet (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet, wet, wet (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep (Ah)
Need a Henny drinker, need a (Woo) smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Cookie A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him (Mmm), now he diabetic
I don't wanna (Mmm), I wanna (Woo)
I wanna (Ah), I wanna (Sco')
I want you to touch (Touch that, huh) that swing in the back of my
My talk game is fire, (Dasani) Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
The way that I spit and now he tryna sign me, woo

[Outro: Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B, Both]
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet, wet, wet (Ah, ah, ah)
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet, wet, wet

Bet It,rap,cardi b,2021,14016,"[Intro: Camilo Sesto, Cardi B]
Un adiós sin razones
Unos años sin valor
Bardi

[Verse 1]
Ain't no half-steppin', all I do is break records
Now I play chess, so a bitch can't checker
Made it out of hell and it's still gettin' hectic
And my life is a movie, only Cardi could direct it
Only take cash, they ain't never gave credit
Had to risk it all in myself, so I bet it
Started on the pole, in the end, don't regret it
They'll use the past against you if you let 'em
But I'm back and I'm better, got Henny on the line
Tell her that I have real shit on my mind
'Cause the clocks start tickin' from the day I got signed
Million-dollar watch 'cause a bitch got time
They'll tell you everything 'bout me but the grind
Tell you there's a bitch this hot, then they lyin'
If I pay for the streams, why the fuck you ain't buyin'?
When these hoes start hatin', these hoes start lyin'
[Chorus: Camilo Sesto]
Años sin valor

[Verse 2]
I got dressed for the stages, got dressed for the court
Dressed for my husband, told him, ""Rip this shit off""
Got dressed for the GRAMMYs, then I left with awards
Hundred-thousand dollar dress left on the floor
They was losin' they mind when I hit the Met Gala
Tail so long, it dragged thirty minutes after
After the tears, you can get to the laughter
After the bookings, on to the next chapter
Got goals that I want, got goals that I met
Gold on my neck that I froze in baguettes
More movie sets mean more movie checks
'Cause I live in a mansion, I don't live with regrets
Plans for the fam, got Kulture the jet
Told us to invest, so the culture is set
Blam-blam-blam, if you posin' a threat
Never did it for clout, never talked on the set, bitch

[Chorus: Camilo Sesto, Cardi B]
Años sin valor
Uh

[Verse 3]
Who they all come get when they want shit chartin'?
Labels hit me when they wanna break artists
After we break bread, then we get shit started
I don't say want it unless Cardi B on it
Then I'm on some shit 'cause I done some shit
Checks sound like I just won some shit
Shoot up the charts like I gun some shit
Got a Reebok deal 'cause I run this shit
All the dope boys want all the Wall Street dudes
Chefs in the mansions, I don't even buy food
Used to laugh at my raps, sayin' I would get booed
Now I get a big bag, that's a big move
From the Bronx to the 'burbs, make big moves
Rock red bottoms, made 'em big shoes
Paid dues, and I'm so focused
'Cause the money never made me, bein' broke did, bitch

Make you wanna act right
Broke boys don't deserve no kitty

Haters can't do nothin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a stick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Shorties speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' it, pullin' up and droppin' it
Gotta argue with him 'cause you know he love a toxic chick
**** out here playin', gotta make 'em understand
If ain't no ring on my finger, you ain't goin' on my 'Gram
