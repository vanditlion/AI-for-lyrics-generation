[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playin'
We're just friends, what are you sayin'?
Said ""There's another,"" and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around, and I'm like

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

Runaway Love Remix,pop,justin bieber,2011,52530,"[Intro: Raekwon]
Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said, ""Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?""
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this sixteen years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to ""Cash Rules""
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, ""You lookin' good, fly colored Asian""
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh why, I must be blind?
How did I let you get away?
Hahah, yeah

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this ****, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough

It's your chance take her hand to the floor
Fellas just the moment you've been waiting for
Girl if you see something you like then let them know
Ladies I know you’re ready
Because you only got one chance, yeah yeah
For your first dance, you never forget about your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam
Tell them J.B., yeah, man

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
When I close my eyes, I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long for this day to come
Now that it's here, let's make it special
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, ain't no chaperones
This could be the night of your dreams

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

We're rocking back and forth under the disco ball

Everybody says that we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

See, I never thought that I could walk through fire (Eh)
I never thought that I could take the burn (Eh)
I never had the strength to take it higher (Eh)
Until I reached the point of no return (Eh)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
(Never say it, never-never say it)
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never thought that I could feel this power (Eh)
I never thought that I could feel this free (Eh)
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower (Yeah)
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh

[Verse 3: Jaden & Justin Bieber]
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB
Uh-huh
I gotcha, lil bro
I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood (Let's go!)
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land (I'm gone)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden]
I will never say never, I will fight (Never say it, never-never say it)
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Never say never
I will never say never (Never say it, never-never say it)
Never say never
I will fight 'till forever make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground

If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don’t
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don’t never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I‘ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy
[Pre-Chorus]
I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go

[Bridge]
So give me a chance, ‘cause you’re all I need, girl
Spend a week with your boy, I’ll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man (If I was your man), I’d never leave you, girl
I just wanna love and treat you right

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go (Oh yeah)
Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone (Never be alone)

Justin Bieber
Damn damn J.B, where the hell you been
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds
2 big face Rollies, no I ain't lyin'
Making momma so proud that she cryin'
Yeah you say I'm crazy? Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums when I was only 2
Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses

Wait...I'm not done

[Verse 2]
I thanked Jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hun' of these cause baby I'm a money tree
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that ""It's not mine""
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurry",en,"justin bieber damn damn j . b , where the hell you been yeah i got a new necklace , diamonds 2 big face rollies , no i ain't lyin' making momma so proud that she cryin' yeah you say i'm crazy ? guess that makes two but i never knew that dreams really came true started playing drums when i was only 2 now we kick it in japan , kung-fu so i'm heading for the gold , i'm sweating i swear otis redding will be oh-so ready i already got ahead-y of the game , i'm with kenny and we steady getting many , i mean money riding in an all-black benz with the all black rims and we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses wait . . . i'm not done  i thanked jesus at the awards i'm never going to hell call me zack morris , i'm saving you by the bell my girl says i'm perfect she just loves an imperfect person perfectly personally i think she is perfectly perfect i get it done abundantly , she wants to get up under me i swear i got a hun' of these cause baby i'm a money tree so be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny i got honeys all up on me baby i just get it done-y possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible and logically will probably but you just take me lyrically try to feel me spiritually , get out your mind literally there's a bigger me inside this little me screaming out i should make history i am like a mystery , hated by jealousy cause they envy me run up on my enemies see if they remember me soon as they remember me i wipe away their memory can't you see the private jets flying over you ? i ain't even notice but my focus on my photos might be bogus , no they shouldn't be a photoshoot it's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time playing with camera claiming that ""it's not mine"" just calm down , you don't gotta hurry don't be nervous , you don't gotta worry and my fans are like my glasses , yeah without them i'd be blurry","['justin', 'bieber', 'damn', 'damn', 'j', 'b', 'hell', 'yeah', 'got', 'new', 'necklace', 'diamonds', 'big', 'face', 'rollies', 'ai', 'lyin', 'making', 'momma', 'proud', 'cryin', 'yeah', 'crazy', 'guess', 'makes', 'knew', 'dreams', 'came', 'true', 'started', 'playing', 'drums', 'kick', 'japan', 'kung', 'fu', 'heading', 'gold', 'sweating', 'swear', 'otis', 'redding', 'oh', 'ready', 'got', 'ahead', 'y', 'game', 'kenny', 'steady', 'getting', 'mean', 'money', 'riding', 'black', 'benz', 'black', 'rims', 'looking', 'black', 'lenses', 'wait', 'thanked', 'jesus', 'awards', 'going', 'hell', 'zack', 'morris', 'saving', 'bell', 'girl', 'says', 'perfect', 'loves', 'imperfect', 'person', 'perfectly', 'personally', 'think', 'perfectly', 'perfect', 'abundantly', 'wants', 'swear', 'got', 'hun', 'cause', 'baby', 'money', 'tree', 'little', 'honey', 'little', 'bitty', 'bunny', 'got', 'honeys', 'baby', 'y', 'possibly', 'probably', 'thinking', 'type', 'swag', 'impossible', 'logically', 'probably', 'lyrically', 'try', 'feel', 'spiritually', 'mind', 'literally', 'bigger', 'inside', 'little', 'screaming', 'history', 'like', 'mystery', 'hated', 'jealousy', 'cause', 'envy', 'run', 'enemies', 'remember', 'soon', 'remember', 'wipe', 'away', 'memory', 'private', 'jets', 'flying', 'ai', 'notice', 'focus', 'photos', 'bogus', 'photoshoot', 'funny', 'wanna', 'picture', 'like', 'time', 'playing', 'camera', 'claiming', 'calm', 'got', 'ta', 'hurry', 'nervous', 'got', 'ta', 'worry', 'fans', 'like', 'glasses', 'yeah', 'blurry']",3,Romantic and Relationships

Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Busta Rhymes)]
Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum (Yeah)
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
(Let's gather 'round the mistletoe real quick)
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
(Matter fact, let's gather 'round the fireplace, it's about to get hot in here)
Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
(I'ma needa get straight to it)
[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, ""Let's make it hot up in the winter"", I said ""Cool""
You know I'ma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

Got me thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, no no no

When I be thinking 'bout them kisses girl, so are you
Man I heard some things but I don't know what's true
But people say you really like me and I hope that's true
You my baby girl and I hope you know it
A boy will tell you that he loves you, but a man will show it
That's why you in my arms, just for the day
Cause less than months go by, you be dancing away
But let's just have some fun girl, as long as you're here
Cause when you get up on that plane, you'll be gone for a year
And when you come up in my room I'll be bawling some tears
But people say just live in the moment, it's wrong to be scared
Girl is it wrong to be scared? Cause that's what they say
And everyday that I don't see you, you slipping away
And all the teachers in my class thinking I'm crazy
But they don't know that I think about you daily cause I be

Anywhere you wanna go, it's your choice
Every time that I'm away, girl I miss your voice
And I promise that I'm nothing like them other boys
I came from the bottom, now I'm at the top
Tell you I love you every day and that'll never stop
They say it's true love, well is love true?
Yeah I think it's love, that's why I found you
And not a second that goes by that I don't think you are so fly
And I know why ain't no guy gon' treat you like I
Wanna, gonna be the man that treats you right, be the man to hold you tight
You know I know you right, let's go into the night

Girl, it's almost a new year, and it's too clear
Me you and a root bear, float in my house
'Bout to count down 'cause we got a whole crew here
Yo, they 'bout to party hardy, looking for a hottie with a nice body
Oh, y'all have fun with that
And we don't need the mistletoe, we was under that
Like 20 minutes ago
And if you gave me all your love, better give me some more
'Cause the new year coming, you ain't trippin' no more
So I don't need music, rather listen to your h-h-h-h-h-h-heartbeat

One Less Lonely Girl,pop,justin bieber,2009,68590,"[Intro]
Alright, let's go
There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

[Verse 1]
How many I told you's and start overs and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises, be honest girl, how many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed, just to take them back, tell me that, how many either ors?
But no more if you let me inside of your world, there'll be one less lonely girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, saw so many pretty faces before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you, I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you
No no, don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine in the world, there's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, I'm going to put you first
I'm coming for you, I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do if you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
[Verse 2]
Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February, not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates and he didn't even touch his food?
How many torn photographs are you taping back, tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world, there'll be one less lonely girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, saw so many pretty faces before I saw you, you

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl

[Bridge]
I can fix up your broken heart, I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe, yeah, I just want to set one girl free to fall
Free to fall, she's free to fall, fall in love with me
Her heart's locked, and know what, I got the key, I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

Yeah, just wait a minute
Starting to hate the minute
We have to pay the minute
Yah alright ok the minute

Marvin told us we should get it on, right here in the restaurant
Ain't no point in waitin', baby, I can get you what you want
Leprechaun gold, got leprechaun gold
And I came out hot like I was steppin' on coals
But I never got cold, keepin' extra long dough
For a rainy day, need a vacation, name a place, we can go

Sneakin' out to meet around like two o'clock in the eve
Paparazzi ain't a problem, we just hide on the beach
Girl, you hotter than me, let's go fly overseas
Or just slide up in the closet, never findin' the key
'Cause seven minutes in heaven ain't enough when we're together
Kisses to the forehead, when I slide my hands to second (Uh)
Wait a second, smilies in a text
I kinda be interested, I'm lyin', girl, I'm obsessed
Stylish sun dresses, legs in jean shorts
Please pick me, love is a team sport (Uh)
I'll be your boyfriend, jokes and pillow talk
Lay around in our undies, chill, play Tony Hawk
Dance slow in the dark, come roll with the Roth

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
We're under pressure (We're under pressure)
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in (Tryna fit in)
Keep it together (Keep it together)
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning (Frowning)
But hey now (Hey now), you know, girl (You know, girl)
We both know, it's a cruel world (Cruel world)
But I will (But I will) take my chances

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, love me
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I'll be your soldier (I'll be your soldier)
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
(For your dreams, girl)
I'll be your Hova (I'll be your Hova)
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress (Don't stress), and don't cry (And don't cry)
Oh, we don't need no wings to fly (Wings to fly)
Just take (Take), my hand

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Whoa, whoa, B-I-G
I don't know if this makes sense, but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there
Girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we on top of the world (World) 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out, like whoa (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot (Shoot)
Ask me, ""What's my best side?""
I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

Yeah (Okay)
Once again (All around the world-world-world)
The dynamic duo is back at it
JB, Luda
[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
All around the world, people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us

Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me
I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be?
Could this be happening to me, yeah?
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

In my head, we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

Could it be a possibility?

It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us

Should I tell her how I really feel?
Should I move in close or just be still?
How will I know?
Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same, oh?

Could it be a possibility?

Fall,pop,justin bieber,2012,107615,"[Verse 1]
Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Verse 2]
Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you’s gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

[Interviewer:]
Justin Bieber
Pop star Justin Bieber
Denied he fathered a child
There is a lot of good that comes with celebrity, you know that
There is also a pretty white hot spotlight
And you found yourself under it recently, some headlines

[Bieber]
To set the record straight, none of it is true

[Interviewer]
Do you know this woman?

[Bieber]
Never met the woman, so

[Interviewer]
No? Okay, well, obviously this is what comes along with, uh
Life in the fast lane as they say


[Verse 1]
She said she met me on the tour
She keeps knocking on my door
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl she wouldn't stop
Almost had to call the cops
She was schemin', oh, she was wrong

[Chorus]
Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didn’t give it to her, I'm talking to you

[Chorus]
Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Cause she's talking it, she needs to quit
But I never hit it; I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
[Verse 2]
Now she's in the magazines
On TV making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news
Saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

[Chorus]
Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didn’t give it to her, I'm talking to you

[Chorus]
Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?

And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Why are you trying, trying to lie girl
When I ain't never met you at all
Saying goodbye, but how could ya
You do this, you prove this
Your foolness, seduces

That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
[Verse 2]
I lose my appetite (Can't eat, can't eat)
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner, 'cause of my dinner, still there on my plate?
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference, and it's starting today

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

I pray for the brokenhearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need, I pray
Can you give 'em one today?

Can someone tell me how to make a change?

Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we'd be living the American Dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would
[Verse 2]
I would build the love of river wide so that it never runs dry, yeah
Any time you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry
And though I wanna make it right, I just can't read your mind, no

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

Do you do what you did when you did with me? Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me? Cause baby I didn't

That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh

It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced

'Cause you're my angel sent from above

Give you little more because I love ya, love ya

The love, the love is bigger

Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down (No)
Like a seesaw let you down (Oh)
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger) I'm bigger (Hey, hey)
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me (Still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me (Hey)
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No)
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

Remember those stone washed jeans (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My baby)

Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
It's gone out of control

Down to Earth,pop,justin bieber,2009,41752,"[Verse 1]
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

[Pre-Chorus]
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth

And mommy, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town

You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here

Stuck In the Moment,pop,justin bieber,2010,36045,"[Intro]
With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place

[Verse 1]
Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
[Verse 2]
See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't wanna fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Bridge]
You see, like, just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
[Breakdown]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (And space)
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Kiss and Tell,pop,justin bieber,2010,9390,"[Intro]
Yeah, JB, yeah, woah, no no

[Verse 1]
Now I can see it girl, you ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me like they want to do something
I feel the chemistry, yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind, had a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give

[Pre-Chorus]
Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB cause
The only people that should know is you and me so

[Chorus]
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?
[Verse 2]
It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl, telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ all in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl if you want to ride with me
And if you want to tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?

Don't tell your girlfriends, that'll start some drama
Stay off that Facebook, I'll treat you real good

Someday At Christmas,pop,justin bieber,2011,4070,"[Verse 1]
Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

[Verse 2]
Someday at Christmas we'll see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today
[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Fall Acoustic Live,pop,justin bieber,2013,12727,"[Verse 1]
Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
Well you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

[Chorus]
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Verse 2]
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't want to lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
[Pre-Chorus]
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song  I'll have figured out

[Chorus]
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Bridge]
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself

Let me start off with the old school flow

[Verse 1]
Let me start off with the old school flow
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that?
Tell me where the cash at, I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits, I got number one flicks
And the number one kicks and number one chicks
Fast like Gordon and my jams like Jordan
And my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboarded in
And my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune?
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this
People in their basements say that I didn't write this
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this
Checks like Nike. let me give you a good night kiss
Well I'm a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering
Like picking on a little kid, like taking all his licorice
I hate it when they littering, I hate to be illiterate
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha
And I'mma go right through you  and I'm so much cooler
And I don't need Luda

And it’s about time I shake my way across the town

That you stay on my mind each and every day

And when it’s building inside, then I can’t pretend
No I don’t want to fight it, I don’t want to hide the way I feel

Tell me no one will treat you better

Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before

What? Wait
But yesterday we were
I don't understand

[Verse 1]
We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say that you're the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round, thinking that I'm so cool
Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?
Finally if I didn't make her cry
She wouldn't be with another guy

[Chorus]
Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It’s gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here
[Verse 2]
Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said, ""Forever I'll be yours""
Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave, it feels like you're still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and you’re not there, woah?

[Chorus]

Say I'm too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
But, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the pain

How To Love Remix,pop,justin bieber,2011,1381,"[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a young’un you’re looks but so precious
But now you’re grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love

[Verse 2]
I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
You're the one I need

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
[Bridge]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault
Wasn’t in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don’t want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love

Mamas Boy,pop,justin bieber,2013,1177,"[Verse 1]
Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-classmen drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPod's the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

Set A Place At Your Table,pop,justin bieber,2013,523,"[Verse 1]
Things seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles I'm used to seeing just weren't there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear [?] was

[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

[Verse 2]
I was feeling kind of helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
I know there's something I can do
[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

[Bridge]
Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day, just laugh, talk and eat

She dances in these sheets at night
She dances to his needs

Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
""Sir, I must be home tonight""
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just won't appreciate
And though she takes, her love in vain
Though she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
[Verse 3: Justin Bieber and Michael Jackson]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own (Her own)
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Oh my goodness, why you wearing two rollies?
I got time and I got money and I got girls like it’s not funny
Honey, honey, what you want from me?
C'mon bunny my-my bunny, my playboy bunny, honey

She sees it’s me she says “Hello”
I say “What's good?” she says “Let's go”
So took her home, TKO

Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 1]
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh
[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 2]
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
[Bridge]
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
""I love you, need you, need you here to stay""

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else? If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my ""grant it"" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' ""Finally Famous!"" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer

[?] wants to make contact [?]
It’s been 72 hours since the crash
A fiery ball come clashing from the sky
Reports still show no known survivors
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
[?]
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn’t have a friend, didn’t know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You’re my best friend please listen to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Greetings, I fell from the sky
I’m from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And our flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived
I’ve only taking over this planet since I arrived
I’m in a backpack, I’m ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne’s world

[Bridge: News Reporters]
Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
After [?]
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
UFO [?]
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy

Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
It's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant

Love is like appreciation mixed in a double cup of Sprite

No left or right
You go your way
And I'll go mine

And I won’t waste it
Thinking 'bout what you gotta say
Cause I'm here to stay

And when it goes down and it’s all said and done
You gotta stand up so there’s no need to run

I won’t look back no
Sacrifice what meant the most to me
The most to me, yes I did

What up JB? It's time to go to the club
Time to pull those toys out man skrr

Let everybody know that I'm here tonight, as soon as I walk in the door
Hey, pretty lady I think I need you in my life, in fact I know I need you for sure

You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it
Ain't a problem baby girl, when you’re winning
Tell me what you wanna do, we can make a move now
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feelin', tell me why you grinning
I think you're likin' what I'm sayin'
Do I really gotta say any more?
You need to know that I ain't playin'
Baby what are we waitin' for?

Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs (lean!)
I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J. Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out, Giussepe steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian
All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me ""Your Majesty""
[Verse 5: Offset]
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

I don't work harder when it's easy

But but but now you're gone, so far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong, we were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favourite song, she was wrong, I am gone
I thought I loved her, never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover, but now until another like

Stuck In the Moment Acoustic,pop,justin bieber,2010,2270,"[Verse 1]
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie & Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
[Verse 2]
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I don't care, I got you baby
See we both
Fighting every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
But fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
[Bridge]
See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree and I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go, so we'll never know

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place, oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment

To keep a roof above our heads
You chose
A life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you, for the strength you’ve instilled in me
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me mom
You were so brave
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me

When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher

I still turn to you, I still turn to you

It was ’94
The year that everything started to change
From before
You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways
Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him, and you could not ignore the love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart

When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher

From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon through the galaxy
As long as you're with me baby

Down to Earth Acoustic,pop,justin bieber,2010,2456,"[Verse 1]
I never thought that it'd be easy cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer, but just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

[Pre-Chorus]
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth

Woah, so far away, and now I just need you here

I'm praying that time makes a change in your life

Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no

I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it

But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em

They ain't never had a chance, how you got it

She texts me ""How's you love life?""
And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good""

Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever

I says whatever

Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me

Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Everything, anything that I could dream

The bed won't sleep the same

Emotions ain't the same

Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that

Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?

Telling you that we just friends
But flying them out on the weekend

Love Yourself Drewsome Remix,rap,justin bieber,2016,2007,"[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think it should be somethin'
That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Verse 2: Drewsome]
Now lemme start off by saying this
I never let another woman do what you did
And I held myself back from ever talking shit
Cause I swore to always be the bigger man and never diss
But what you've been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didn't and you know that's some middle school shit
All we were was just friends, good friends that it
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I don't have time to care and I couldn't if I tried
So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight
And it's a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think I'm still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight

Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never

Hold up, aight? I can handle them

And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood, swish
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

They just wanna play with me, they just wanna play with me
Just got back from the Middle East
Maybe just a little cheese, still wanna play with me?
Back to the crib for two minutes, I got something to do
Yeah, you get it
Yeah I copped something new, a new get-up
Yeah, phone coming through, you keep your head up
Gotta have all the new kicks, better have all the new tricks
And my bank go shit, gotta have all the new whips
Gotta have all the new chicks, my bad, I'm sick
I never had a problem with a money clip
Paper always glazed like a honey dip
I was always raised like ""Honey, quit""
I'm just being funny with this funny ish

What’s up Jaden?
I’m feeling nice right now
I’m feeling good to bro
I’m feeling really nice right now
Swag
Swaggy
I’m in my closet right now
Literally in your closet?
I’m literally in my closet right now recording this song like a g

You are a g bro
You’re a wrap
You’re a wrap bro
Ah swag
Swaggy, swaggy, swaggy, swaggy

(Jaden Smith)
Oh, I ain’t never met a groupie
All I meet is ladies
And I like my privacy
So I got a Mercedes
Got these chokers shaking
Reminding me have hated
Sorry ’bout the security
It’s only for your safety
Cause baby I’ll be pimpin’
Holler if you see me
I’m probably in Miami
With my girl in a bikini
Text me if you need me
Touch me if you’re greedy
‘Cause you’ll probably be with Nicki
Walking while she says Waikiki
How we the illest and the youngest?
I really don’t know how we the killest and the dumbest
Swear it’s really early
But I don’t know where the sun is
And girl just take my hand
While I knock away these hundreds

Cause the crowd is going crazy
Money coming in bundles
Sorry that I couldn’t see you
It’s hard to see through my stunners
Dumb blondes be sayin’ I’m the funnest
All I’m hearing is claps
Though I don’t know where the drum is
Girl you like it
So just give me the mic
And I’ll get you so excited
Tell me what you want
I’ll go home and write it
To a old school beat
Baby take your lip and bite it
Oh jeez
Girl you got me and you gon’ make me work
Cause it’s usually a hobby
And no I really like you
And no it’s not your body
But trust me that’s a plus
Cause you’re hotter than wasabi
And I’m diggin’ on your kicks
Jokers talking ’bout karate
When I want a girl I just whip out the Maserati
No I can’t drive it
It’s only for the show
And I like to wear them diamonds
Watch them circus glow
Girl I’m on like a light bulb
Are you coming home from the night club?
‘Cause I tried to get in but I ain’t reached the height limit
That might be over but the night isn’t so I’m
So text me if you tryna chill with Wesley
Cause me and Mandy are chillin’
So don’t wear nothing dressy
Inside jokes are only funny when you get them
So (?) is the place to be (?) and I’m living in them dance halls
Alright J I think I got it from here
Justin Bieber
Headphones on yeah
Turn them up a little bit
(Justin Bieber)
Baby I’m the man
I felt that you knew that
I’m out in Japan
Just because I do that
So baby don’t you stop it
Baby can you drop it
I give you my chain
I style like Kentucky
Money on my mind
And you on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too big for my time
And everybody know that

Baby I’m the man
Can’t you understand
Keep you wondering
If I’m the wonderman
And you’re in wonderland

Hey my name is JB
I’m always rocking Vans
And if I was your boyfriend
I would love you till the end
I’d kiss your face in public
You can tell all of your friends
Baby girl you got that body
Would you like to go to France?
We can fly there on my jet babe
I can give you jetlag
I don’t do Jamaica baby
I can make you sweat babe
And if you ain’t in the crew
You’ll never get this

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name

You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

Maybe you should know that

And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance

[Verse 1]
Get a little closer to me too
I get a little shy when we start to move
I get a little high when I'm tryna decide if it's London or China too
Forget about the plans that you got, baby
Kiss me like you can't have too many
The Earth is like 'round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know

So in the meantime, I'm living and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love

Get a little excited from across the room
I just can't seem to keep my eyes off you
Smile at me, so I smile at you
Then you feel so loved, when I dance with you
Tonight the way that you're moving
Make me wanna lose it

As Long As You Love Me International Version,pop,justin bieber,2017,1082,"[Intro]
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

[Verse 1]
We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me
[Verse 2]
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress and don't cry
Oh we don't need no wings to fly
Just take, my hand

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me

I don't need money
I don't need cars no
I don't need to shine if I got your heart
Beating right here
Here with me
Baby that's all I need

You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

[Bridge]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
[Verse 2]
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

So Sick Cover,pop,justin bieber,2007,6437,"[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this (enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you
[Hook]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Verse 2]
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason

[Hook]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Bridge]
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

Break From Love,pop,justin bieber,2018,4998,"[Verse 1]
You called me, tried to shake the other line
In a hurry, know you didn't have the time
To wait on my broken promises
I sought you, the reason with no rhyme

We tried to work it out, we tried way back when
Your heart was spilling over without an end
I hurt you once before I hurt you again
You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in
So

Su-sustaining will last a test of trial
This burning will only last a while

Stuck In the Moment Remix,pop,justin bieber,2011,509,"[Intro: Justin Bieber]
With you
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sittin' here, thinkin' ""where is you now?""
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you, I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than it's gon' come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say it's puppy
Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
Loving you, it was us against the world
You my favorite girl, for you, I would go to war
I take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care
I got you, baby
See, we both fightin' every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
See, like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place (Oh no no)
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (And space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' that Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them, he wears in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me, made me aware what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, I can not lie to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on the shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

Heart full of equity, you're an asset

Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now

Get that ring, just like Toronto

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Chance the Rapper]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

Life Is Worth Living Demo,pop,justin bieber,2017,72,"[Verse 1]
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down

He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over

Don't think that I’ll be a saint

'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy

Runnin’ to the altar like a track star

Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake

I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave mе life
Baby, I can't explain

The pimps and the players say, ""Don’t go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

Now it feels like I don’t even know her
You would think that I never used to hold her
She believes everything that they told her
She was mad there was girls in the folder
Tried to tell her it was nothing but a photo
She gets advice from a friend that’s lonely
I hope she hears these words that I say

Don’t listen to your friends
Follow your heart baby and let me in
Follow your heart baby and know that I’m here

Cold water,pop,justin bieber,2020,2976,"Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?

I will still be patient with you

Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

[Verse 1]
Maybe I stare too much
Maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair
Dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm s'posed to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I say ""I love you"" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much
[Verse 2]
Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends' problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second
I met my biggest blessing
Prayed for you, look what God has done

I couldn't fight this feeling, oh no
I'm the type to give you everything I have
She’s priceless for real, oh whoa
You don’t ever have to do a thing
But give me all your love and affection, oh whoa
You have something going for yourself
That’s the type of girl for me

Hey girl, do I feel like everything in my life (My life)
Jump again and end with late night
I think I love you more than I love me (I really do)
You say you love me more, is that right? (Yeah)
I doubt it I change the thing that I can
If you could never mind the thing that I can't
If you appreciate the man that I am
And not remind me the things that I ain't
I can't just stand around and be fake (Nah)
'Cause of the type of people we hate (Haha)
It's a private estate, you wrapped around my heart
Can't believe I let you walk through these gates
Love seein' your tattoos and your toes out
From a presidential to a fold guy
You stuck with me, I'm fuckin' with you
Suck and whine, throwing down with you
I saw what I want, I took that (Took it)
Since then shawty a look bad (Never)
If them don't wanted you as much as I do (Heh)
If I would tell you to get to it bad (Shown up)
This is staying like me, girl (I see you, girl)
And my boo, you're a keeper, girl (You're a keeper, girl)
Smile every time I see you, girl (I see you, girl)
Hurts every time I leave a girl (Ay)

I say to you this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it, then you aren't fit to live
You may be 38 years old as I happen to be
And one day some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
Some great issue, some great cause
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
You're afraid that you will lose your job
Or you're afraid that you will bе criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or you're afraid that somеbody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
Well, you may go on and live until you are 90
But you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit
You died when you refused to stand up for right
You died when you refused to stand up for truth
You died when you refused to stand up for justice",en,"i say to you this morning , that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it , then you aren't fit to live you may be 38 years old as i happen to be and one day some great opportunity stands before you and calls upon you to stand up for some great principle some great issue , some great cause and you refuse to do it because you are afraid you refuse to do it because you want to live longer you're afraid that you will lose your job or you're afraid that you will bе criticized or that you will lose your popularity or you're afraid that somеbody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house and so you refuse to take the stand well , you may go on and live until you are 90 but you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90 and the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit you died when you refused to stand up for right you died when you refused to stand up for truth you died when you refused to stand up for justice","['morning', 'found', 'dear', 'precious', 'die', 'fit', 'live', 'years', 'old', 'happen', 'day', 'great', 'opportunity', 'stands', 'calls', 'stand', 'great', 'principle', 'great', 'issue', 'great', 'cause', 'refuse', 'afraid', 'refuse', 'want', 'live', 'longer', 'afraid', 'lose', 'job', 'afraid', 'bе', 'criticized', 'lose', 'popularity', 'afraid', 'somеbody', 'stab', 'shoot', 'bomb', 'house', 'refuse', 'stand', 'live', 'dead', 'sensation', 'breathing', 'life', 'belated', 'announcement', 'earlier', 'death', 'spirit', 'died', 'refused', 'stand', 'right', 'died', 'refused', 'stand', 'truth', 'died', 'refused', 'stand', 'justice']",10,Romantic and Relationships

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
We reject what we don't understand
We turn our backs on a fellow man
I wanna change, but my heart is bleedin'
Heart is hard, and can't nobody see me
I wanna be there for the ones that need me
I can't stand the pain I see on TV
Jealous 'cause they wanna be me
Damn it man, this life ain't easy
It takes over me
My unforgiveness keeps control of mе
Damnit, I gotta get a hold of me
Gotta get a hold of mе, oh
What you want out of life? That's the question
This ain't a simulation, it's a blessing
Is it a mistake or is it destined?
We ain't got no time for second guessin'
We can't save ourselves, we need a savior
We ain't make ourselves, we need a maker
I keep failin' myself, I need somethin' new
So I lay my life down, I give it all to You
[Bridge: Chandler Moore]
All to You, give it all to You (I give it all to You)
Give it all to You, give it all (I give it all to You)
Oh, oh

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & Chandler Moore]
I came to the end of me, believin' the enemy
Comin' with that ""Mmm"", man, you ain't a friend of me
Nothing can fix that, ooh, not even the Hennessy
I had to switch it up, yeah, switch up the remedy
God, can You use imperfect people? (Oh)
'Cause I'm broken through and through (Oh)
Just tell me where I need to go (Need to go)
'Cause that's all that I wanna do (All that I wanna do)
I'm a mess, but I'm tryna grow
I'm upset, but I still wanna know
Is there more for my life
Or is that all she wrote? (Is that all she wrote?)
Uh, is that all she wrote? (Is that all that she wrote?)
Is that all she wrote? (Is that all that she wrote?)
Is that all she wrote?

[Verse 3: Brandon Love]
Thanks to all them Judas kisses, I got a master's in forgiveness
I don't need a jail system, I walk in conviction
I'd rather pray to God, than pray for wishes
I'm supernatural, not superstitious, there's a difference
Like relationship versus religion, that's a prison
I'm lightin' circle, then royal purple inside a prism
This flow is so universal, it came with dreams and visions
I got the keys to the kingdom, I'm 'bout my Father business
I came up straight from the bottom, I started from the finish
You can't undermine a mastermind
I may be out of your mind, but I ain't out of mine
I'm co-crucified, bury, resurrected
And perfected in the Son of God
Just like water turn to wine, I'm a prophetic sign
Ask your barber, I'ma headliner in New York Times
My life verses, I am His, yeah, and He is mine
The great ""I Am's"", the greatest Lamb of all time
Rebranded, redesigned and redefined
From Brandon to brand new
I'ma brand name in the household, brand too
Who are you to try to tell me what I can't do? We need a pull, huh?

You ever ask yourself ""Am I gonna make it?""

Were In This Together,rap,justin bieber,2021,34458,"[Intro]
Yeah, it's not easy growin' up
You know, mm

[Verse 1]
Only two years old, I was playin' drums on the table
Guess I knew it was the only thing stable
When I was young, I could pick things up quick
Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it
Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker
Thought I knew everything in life, yeah, that caught up to me later, hehe
I had to learn about humility
I had to grow up and accept responsibility, yeah
That wasn't easy, 'cause at seventeen, I had a milli'
Women throwin' themselves at me had me goin' silly
On the surface, I felt like thе man
But deep inside I felt deprivеd just like an empty can

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had everything in life that people strive for (Strive for)
Just to ask the question: ""What are we alive for?"" (Alive for)
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, what would you die for? (Die for)
Is there a reason? What is the meaning? What do we cry for?
[Chorus]
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh
We're in this together

[Verse 2]
I moved out when I was eighteen
I was livin' in a mansion doin' big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin' dicey
I was doin' stupid shit to get people to like me
All that to say, I'm thankful that's not who I am
And I'm thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
'Cause He's the reason that I'm still standin'
And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin'
Plannin' peace, plannin' joy, plan another day
Gave His life upon the cross to wash our sins away

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question: ""What are we alive for?""
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, what would you die for?
Is there a reason? What is the meaning? What do we cry for?

[Chorus]
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh
We're in this together
[Outro]
I pray for every single person listening to this song right now
I pray for peace. I pray for joy. I pray for confidence. I pray for reassurance
I thank you so much for the person listening to this right now
I pray that You would bless them
Bless their mind, bless their finances
Bless their family, bless their sons, bless their daughters, bless their moms, bless their dads, bless their grandparents
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence in their home right now
An overwhelming sense of Your peace that says, ""Everything is going to be all right.""

Why? Why is there nobody like Jesus?

Was He not merely a teacher, a prophet
An exegeter, an explainer and yet we find ourselves in history wondering
""Is there anyone like Jesus?
Who is this Jesus?""
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might become right in our relationship with God?
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
Three days later, did He rise again as the grave empty?
Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?

There's nothing like your touch
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time (Yeah)

I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Mmm, oh; badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, listen; yeah, that's it)

[Verse 3: Usher]
Usher baby
Don't be thinkin' that she mad at you
She from Decatur so she got a little attitude (Yeah)
She do what she wanna do (Uh)
Wonder where she learned to bounce that booty
What's her secret? I bet her mama went to Freaknik
I bought a flight, I need her with me (Yeah)
On the west side, she'll be here tonight (Yeah, uh)
She from Atlanta, she smoke, we call that a peach tree, ooh-wee
I got my peach from out of Georgia
Only one that understands me
Only one know how that lifestyle can be
Always meet me in the middle
Circle of trust, she in the center
Give her what she need
Bought her a condo on the Upper East
Big Apple, but I love that peach
So ripe, and he right, I

Land of the tree, home is the base (Home is the base)
Kush in my woods, smokin' with grace (Smokin' with grace)
Pass it around and give 'em a taste
And you can tell that it's fire by the look on they face
Blame it on Dogg, I did it again (I did it again)
Whole VIP smellin' like it's Christmas
You don't wanna miss this
California weed on ten, this hits different
I'm like, ""JB, where you been?""
This a knockout, nothin' but the heavyweight
Everywhere I go, California weed, state to state
You know I got it on me, finest only
I'm in the buildin'
I make a phone call to all my out of town homies
I'm the ambassador of legalization (Legalization)
I got a passion, I'm leadin' the nation
Haters be hatin' a lot, but all the Dogg got
Is a lot of money, weed, and patience

Keep you on my arm, you'd never be alone
I can be your chest, anything you want

Now them flamingos in my eyebrows won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we gonna keep keep singing to the mountain top
There's gonna be one more feet going buzz
One more feet going buzz
One more feet going buzz

Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
I'll come working
From a thousand miles away

Right now than I ever wanted

With an unpolished finish but something catches

Max and coraline feed jacky's gerbil
Spend another day I'm giving
These sheets are so close

Who swayed to suede
You'll hear it all don't call
Throw away everything I've written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today

Be married, I'm only halfway home
And I can't believe you got kicked
Off a date and dropped you stars

Thugz Mansion Cover,rap,justin bieber,2016,9,"[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand this
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remain
‘Causе all the rest dead; is thеre a spot for us to roll?
If you find it, I'll be right behind it, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm runnin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, uh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place that’s right for me

Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Uh
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
[?] there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
