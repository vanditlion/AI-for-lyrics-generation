Smells Like Teen Spirit,rock,nirvana,1991,2297062,"[Verse 1]
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay
[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

Yeah, hey, yay

And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

Serve the Servants,rock,nirvana,1993,174352,"[Verse 1]

Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold
If she floats then she is not
A witch like we've thought
A downpayment on another

They hurt really bad

But instead, I had a dad

Don't hate you anymore

Go, Krist

[Verse 1]
Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
And all the flowers are everywhere
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

[Verse 2]
Goodbye Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
And I don't know all these words
I had boggy turds
With my BB gun I would kill birds

[Chorus]
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
All our lives, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the world that we reached
Were just starfish on the beach

[Verse 3]
Goodbye Michelle, my little one
I was the apple of the shining sun
Another apple out of reach
All my tears are salty
I think now I was taught to weep

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
All the hills that we climb

Some belong to strangers, and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills, and shake the many hands

Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words

When you've finished with the mop, then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work, it was fun

And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared

Some say it was Greenland, and some say Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses
Wouldn't help you if they could

Where Did You Sleep Last Night?,rock,nirvana,1994,464271,"[Intro]
[Kurt Cobain] Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
[Dave Grohl] What is it?
[Kurt Cobain] This was written by (what?) my favorite performer. Our favorite perfomer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
[Krist Novoselic] Oh and here's a donation basket for one supply of Leadbelly's guitar
[Kurt Cobain] Oh yeah, this guy representing the Leadbelly's estate wants to sell me Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000
[Krist Novoselic] Passing a basket
[Kurt Cobain] Yeah, I even asked David Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me. He wouldn't do it

[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
[Verse 3]
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through (Shiver for me)

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine

I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines the sun don't shine

Soaking all that they can

Cannot look me in the eyes

The entire strip to be washed away
Cleansed, as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol
Flowed through the strip and were set on fire
It didn't just singe the hair, it made it straight
And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom
And his silk
And he—
He erected a beautiful city
A city of stars

A phrase from his pocket
In chains from the no-end, lifelong dream

Erased from this moment
The change from his socket

Stake me out the TV

Got a gun
To bleed me..

Even have some time
Bet it all tonight

If we did not have chemicals

One more day than I can plan
Ends safe from you
Biting ass a lie friend

His silence setting up around

And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups

Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood
And cut them up into two by two feet squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap
And I'm going to cut them into two by two feet squares
And then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach
And I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood

And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood
And glue them onto the plywood and burlap
And sell 'em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar
For my kids' new used new toys and clothing
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that piss-stained mattress
I've been sleeping on

Hormoaning EP Liner Notes,rock,nirvana,2017,460,"In Billboard, the magazine published December 14, 1991, Nevermind was #6 in the CD hit ranking and the single Smells Like Teen Spirit was #23 in the single ranking. Nirvana used to be described as the hopeful band from Seattle before they produced the first record. However, Nirvana is now one of the most popular bands in the US. The music they play doesn't stick to any formalities and leads heavy metal in the new generation, therefore it is called Alternative Heavy Rock. I will neither write more details about Alternative Heavy Rock, nor investigate their music from professional eyes. Anyway, all I can say is that the music of Nirvana influences a lot of teenagers today

Nirvana's commercial success is the biggest mystery in the music scene. I don't want you to misunderstand. I didn't say Nirvana did not have enough ability to get 'Platinum Disk prize,' but nobody could expect they would be such a famous band. The reason people think Nirvana's success is a mystery is that Geffen (the record label that Nirvana and some other popular bands - such as Guns N' Roses - belong to), sold only a few Nevermind [CD's] at first but a lot of young people bought it and Nirvana got big money even then. But I think Nirvana themselves are very surprised about this incident. Actually, I had a chance to interview Kurt Cobain (vocals, guitar) during English concert tours (their supporting acts were their favorite groups, Shonen Knife and Captain America, by the way). He said the following:

""I didn't expect we would be so famous. I didn't even expect that our CD would be in the top 100 ranking in Billboard. You see, we had been in Europe before the great fuss. I don't want to relate with this fuss because I hate that a lot of fans are waiting for us at the airport.""

Kurt Cobain seemed like he was saying ""Don't lose your mind"" to himself during the interview. (personal opinion) Maybe they know a lot of musicians who lost their thoughts and became the toy of mass media. So Kurt Cobain is protecting himself before he goes the same way. Nirvana will come to Japan pretty soon so that you will be able to understand what I am trying to say. Because they will come to Japan, I will advise you about their concert. First thing I have to tell is that the concert is always unsociable. And also they are easily influenced by the environment so it depends on your luck whether the concert is very nice or boring

This CD is released just for Japan [and Australia]. I'd like to introduce each song on this mini-album, but we don't even know what songs will be on the CD. By one Japanese record company's information, two of the songs from the Smells Like Teen Spirit CD single, which are Even In His Youth and Aneurysm. It may also include some songs which were broadcast by BBC Radio-1 in England. It may be just a rumor, but one of them may be their favorite song by the Vaselines

I think that most of the people who bought this mini-CD have Nevermind too. But if it is the first time to buy Nirvana's CD for you, I recommend you to experience Nevermind. I'm sure you'll like it too

Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face

Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-pee pressed against my lips

Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up

I don't need to love again
I won't sigh and mope again
I just don't need to love again
I just don't think it's worth it
I don't really love her
I don't think I want her
Ain't gonna take to love again
It's the way your love hurts
It's the way you're mad again
I don't think I'll love again
I won't ever promise her
I don't think I want her

This time no one else
I don't bear to follow you

Sometimes I don't love you
Think I'm tired of loving her

You told me to follow him
Teach him that I loved him
I won't ever promise you
I won't even bother to
You gave me my first kiss

It's all that I had to have
It's all that I wanted
It's all that I had to
I don't think I'll miss her
I don't think I want

On A Plain Live at Reading,rock,nirvana,2009,229,"[Verse 1]
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

That I ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command
Love myself

So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I’m on a plain

My brother died
Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
The black sheep got
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As defense I’m neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

[Verse 3]
It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don’t make a sense
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong

One more special
Message to go
And then I’m done
And I can go home

Every night

Don't quote me on that

On the zip code

In a dream my memory has stored
As defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
One more special
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

Kurt Cobain: I-I can't say that I've heard a band who sounds like they rip us off, or-or have been influenced by us. And if they have been influenced by us, I hope they've just been influenced by the-the sincerity that we try to-try to put off

Krist Novoselic: At the end of the day, it's the records we put out. If you can put that record on and listen to it, like ""hey, that's a good record"" and all this other junk is just—irrelevant

Reporter: Hello

Krist: Hello

Reporter: Hi. Do you like to provoke the audience?

Krist: No, they provoke us

[Cut - Spoken Intro]

Krist: Since it's Halloween, we thought we'd play the secret song...

[Cut - Interview]

Reporter: How many guitars have you destroyed since your first concert?
Krist: I don't think that has anything to do with the music

Kurt: And that isn't necessarily violence either. It's fun. It's pure fun

[Montage]

Reporter: What did you get by smashing guitars in the scene?

Kurt: Satisfaction. Climax

Krist: Don't have to do encores

Kurt: Yeah, there you go. It's a good excuse, you don't have to do an encore

The Man Who Sold The World Rehearsal,rock,nirvana,2019,960,"[Spoken Intro]
OK, that's where I'm having trouble, because...
No, let's just do it once, because...
The problem that I'm having is that I'm so used to going all the way through and then starting by myself
Okay, so we do it once before you start singing?
The problem is that I'm just not used to hearing Pat do that one chord thing
One more time
(Oops)

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
Made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
For all the millions here
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

On A Plain Devonshire Mix,rock,nirvana,2011,48,"[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that

Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done and I can go home
Love myself better than you
Know it's wrong so what should I do?

Don't hate you anymore

[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched 'til I bled
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so, what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that

Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?

In a dream my memory has storеd
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you

And one more special message to go
And then I'm done and I can go home
Love myself better than you

I Love You 1991 Version,rock,nirvana,2022,12,"Verse 1
I hear your voice from miles away
When I cry in my room
Sadness lining in my eyes
When I hear you
When I hear you
I think I need a change

Chorus 1
Don't cry for me
Don't scream for me
Cause I love you on the inside
I love you, Ur my only soul
So when I'm gone you would cry for me

Yeah I'm quite lonely
Make me happy on the inside
You know I can't deny you
And when you find me
Don't fine me

I love you
I love you
I'd scream I lovе you
Yeah I would
Cause I love you
