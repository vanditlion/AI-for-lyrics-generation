[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Let the mink drag on the floor
She snorting the 70s dope
Up in the ghost she said she need it the most
Quit tripping we having a toast
Step in and out the plane
She act like she Marilyn Monroe
All on the boat showing her boobies the most
Lets toss her and see if she float
We pulled over the car at the liquor store
And if these bitches ain't fresh as me, then what we in here for?
Simply, That nigga wild, Let that nigga go
Easily, just roll up the dope and watch me turn it to smoke and go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Twenty to thirty trill hippies they circle around me
With skin leggings they rocking Marants, but they smoking for free
It's funny ain't it, bitches is destined to be
Living the dream, while you out chasing these hoes
She probably taste-testing my seeds

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Ooooh, that's why we never sleep
It's primetime
When I'm on the phone I'm talking O's
So It's buy time
When I'm on the road turn the lights on
Cus' It's my shine
So all these strobe lights and bulb lights got me

You already know what it is man
We run the world you all ready know
All the young niggas run the world man
Lace your boots up
Kill em niggas with the swag
Kill em niggas with the swag

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
I got this new obsession with stupid flexin' and best dressin'
This Travis Scott and young Veggies that's Peas and Carrots and XX
Niggas think they spit how I spit
Get what I get
Fuck who I smash
I pulled up in the Jag'
Roaches to hoes and they up in the back
I'm up in the back switchin' them lanes
And they thought I would crash
Gettin' some fang give a fuck bout' a name
Iced out carats and I'm going insane
You upset, cause my squad up next
I had enough that, I'm smashing with them back shots
She had a couple thoughts
Told her I ain't trusting that
What these niggas barking bout
Tell me what you tryna say
Boy I make more then your father
I'm sorta an author but more like your daddy
Ask 'bout the boy
Came from the city, we poppin' in Cali

Tell me how I look
Got pharaoh blood in my DNA

Goo Goo Scott no Gaga
Might fuck around and just poke her face
Running red lights, you scurred?
Might fuck around and just swerve
(Wait, shut the fuck up), hallelujah
Bow down when I walk in this bitch
Ho remember that
That was just a modeling chick
9 bitches now wanna go
And tell their bitch screaming: ""Hallelujah""
Fucking with the double x why'd you do it
Leave you hanging watch your momma mop the fluid
Now your casket close, screaming how they knew ya'

Lights Love Sick,rap,travis scott,2012,46691,"[Verse 1]
My momma always ask me 'bout my attitude
Damn, momma, I don't know at all
I met this chick who want to meet me at the avenue
I had a feeling we'd have a ball
She knows stars, I know that, she want cars, I want jets
She want to get eloped, but I don't know yet
Pick up my fur after sitting, hanging in the coat check
Give me calls, she pick me off, I didn't hit the door yet
Damn, I'm sorry, but that bitch gon' be looking love sick
All on TV, crying to Maury, looking love sick
While I'm probably in the Rari, going Audi, fucking with molly
And we running on E, not the gas, but the molly
And she fucking with me so she came to have a party
Now she leaving with me, now you're love sick

[Hook: Daron Eubanks]
Do you realize?
We all want these flashing light, oh
So when you close your eyes
Do you picture us havin' a hell of a night? Oh
[Verse 2]
Dinner time, I'm dining out with a porn star
She remind me of home, L.A., our second home
See see we met at Leon, plenty empty bottles of Lonestar
Conversation was long, how she landed from Rome
Yeah, she did
Later on that night I got her back to the crib
Kicked off My Will&Rich and got her down to her skin
After all she got a little taste test of my kids
You know what, we used to dream about this
A couple models and cribs, way fresher than movies
Should of know it was fake, I could tell by the boobies
Treated life like a safe, load it up and then blew me
Yeah, she did
Head so good, it ain't even cost me
Woke up, she gone, look what I lost
Sheepskin' and that (?)

I don't know about you
Feel like I'm floating through the night

In the night, in the night, in the night, the night
Feel like I'm floating through traffic

This shit be the coldest
Wake up nigga, smell the Folgers
Fuck she throwing up last night
Only if the dumb bitch did what I told her (Told her)
She feel me, I feel her
And she even let me move my fingers up her skirt
Fuck it live for the moment
Had no bread, now the hoes spread like toast is
Her legs spread like Moses
On my way, raise your glass we can have a toast
To the same ones that love talking that wild shit
Be the same ones who wanna be around the most
Tony said soon enough niggas will have a two-tone
Two blond chicks with the roof gone
Complaining now that her breasts out
Well at least you could've thought to put the mink on

Mines is to fly to the summer in my winter clothes
Sin city is a mile away

Hallelujah, does it even matter if it's night or day
When we pull up, she gon' pull her shirt down
This where we find 'em
Same niggas that sniff Donna
And get drunk off the mimosa
Space green or designer
Hermes based off of drama
Call it spendin' yoda
Six years catch me trying yoga
In the Caesar Palace rocking a toga
Throwing a toga party
Chilling with your bitch and she extra naughty

I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We lost in the world who's feeling safe
It's parked outside been in the case
We walk outside feel like a mason
The preacher at the altar to tell you to have a taste
White wine, go ahead and sip your race
And walk in the closet and feel amazed
Ain't no retire, fall out of line and we get to pacin
And we gonna simply reside and fill up the space and
Took the travis may leave you around and place it
That's a classic, no other way to have it
Remember me and my brother slept on that mattress
And look how many bitches piled up on that mattress
I'm feeling too proud, cause all my niggas around
I gotta prove it right now waitin' for ‘em to feel it
It was cool for a second, but now might take a minute
Cause now I'm in the building, god damn, I'm about to kill it

I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating

I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating

[Verse 2: T.I.]
3-57 apparel the shit I wearo be Balenciaga
Prada, Margiela or something hotter
Double barrel your medulla oblongata send you to Allah
A million dollars on my wardrobe, damier on my collars
Nothing short of an assassin, garments I stick my ass in
Kill niggas dead on the scene, no casket
Basking in my glory on the 37th story of a highrise
Ten hoes, nice thighs, mai tais
Serving umbrellas, but I knew the perfect fellow
So impressive, she would this Beretta if I let her
Have a blast of a lifetime, ass of a lifetime
I swear this dick I give her it'll last her a lifetime
A nice night selling hard rock in the pipeline
Put in their life and now they love a nigga longtime
Wednesday three freaks, Thursday four hoes
Five on Friday, yesterday six chicks
Today is the Sabbath I got seven going at it
On a mattress doing shit you can't imagine, I'm laughing
True story, real talk, that's classic
[Hook]
I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Had to leave from home, better off than hell
Skip the town somehow I ended up in jail
Loved the jail, it was better in the cell
Did a little crime, too that shit never ever tell
Somewhat I'm partying the third partying
First she started gargling, and end up swallowing
And went to class too and got some knowledge
You fucking with the devil like she over popping him
She love the pills too she over popping em'
She's standing in the line, just to do the line
Fuck is that fresher than a motherfucker
Tell me wanna fuck with us
Frontline hands up, niggas while we thrown dust

Accidentally walked in the club, all these bitches bite (ooh)

I left her outside, I left her mouth dry
Feed her to the mountain lions 'cause that bitch try countin' mine
Pussy, nigga, you's a pussy-nigga (you just a pussy-nigga)
You be doushin', I be pushin' ether
Bitch, you fuck-boy cunt
Won't be satisfied 'til I see ya'll suffer in the sun
Chiefin' while I'm beefin', turn my odds to evens
My lawyers are some heathens
Beat it blowin' on some on reefers
If you didn't want a war, then why you'd wage it then?
I only wear jeans, I could fit a gage up in
I'm so high right now, look like I'm in Japan
Amazing, junkie jit came up major in
Trench team, ten deep, red beam, laser tag
Bring it, what you got?
Police and pistols don't phase your man

Look up at my eyes and I know you see a bad guy
Try to front on us, man, you better ask them last guys
Suicide doors pull up when we ride by
Goon niggas hop up with guns fuck a drive by
Smokin' weed on the jet, bitch, I'm fly high
You don't wanna give me neck? Bitch, bye-bye
On to the next bitch, I hope she bi-bi
'Cause I love bitches that love bitches that love bitches
I love fuckin' on they friends and I love fuckin' on they sisters
Bad bitches roll my swishers, Goddamn, I'm that nigga
Smokin' on that reefer thinkin', ""How can I get richer?""
Damn shawty bad like the old Detroit Pistons (damn)
Damn I wanna fuck, when I hit, I'm gettin' misses
Treat her like shit man its ""fuck-a-bitch feelings""
Money stacked tall, man, it's touchin' my ceiling
Money stacked tall, man, it's touchin' my ceiling

Holy moly, all them niggas dead
All them pussies fed
Let 'em live? Meh
Young owl in the dark
Thought he'd make it, never
Do you hate 'cause they know I'ma be here forever (straight up)
Never fuck with the black and blue
Duck cause a nigga might shoot
Shocked what a nigga might do
Young nigga blessed like a nigga ah-choo (bless up)
In the Mo they smokin' raw diesel
Evil Knievel whip pullin' off in the dust (skrrt, skrrt!)
Throwin' flame rocks when a bitch might jerk (straight up)
Bouncin' this bitch like it's tennis
Rich and still eatin' at Denny's
Hotels phones, I'm talkin' that business
Came up with the ones that was with me
Besides, nigga, your niggas facade, nigga

Night,rap,travis scott,2013,37350,"[Verse 1]
3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rock stars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of Vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll fuck up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind

But the nights keep fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey

Summertime was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told 'em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with Will and Rich and Quasimodos
So we popped the champagne so drunk
Spilled liquor all over her Vera Wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here

What if the night keeps fallin' hey

Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight

And we party every night
And I blame it all on you

And we gon' fly to Vegas
We gon' raise them glasses when I finally make it
And go home and hit up all the places
Where a nigga grew up and see these bitches I dated
So eager, to treat us like Caesars
I'mma catch amnesia, they gon' have they D's up
So I might remember, when the nights was dimmer
Had nobody to look to, older brother was iller
Seen the look in his eyes, then see straight to her soul
What he feeling inside, damn I never would know

Sweet winter, got head before my dinner
Scream by the half and now we in the mirror
Around this time tonight, niggas is niggas
So we gon' hit the town tonight, roll up the killa
There go my soul, you get the picture
Holy grail filled with wine to pass time
What I fantasize in due time that come alive
And we just pray to god we all be still alive
And we so fly tonight
Hope a nigga touch the sky tonight

And the stars is out so bright
Let 'em shine over you
And we dance across tonight
I blame it all on you

Shut the lights down when I’m in the place
The time is right now, feelin' out of space
It’s like '99, whatever happened to Ma$e
Gotta make it ahead of time like hookers in a race
We gon' shine before they hate us
Eat before the waiters, now more than ever

Man, I'm in these streets, it's been a long day
'Bout to sign this deal and throw it all away
'Bout to cop the crib that Dame lost today
Funny look at them niggas that slippin'
You trippin', no fear, my niggas, we get it
I'm looking down at the whole world through these glass ceilings
And when I step outside bad bitches with me
Back in my section twisting that la la, can't let it stress me
Wake up, fall asleep to Dizzy Gillespie
Ba-back it up and break it down
She gon' bust it on this dick you gon' take her out of town
I put ice in my veneers, I put rubies in my crown
Count them stacks and blow them racks, niggas know who they around

Might go throw a birkin bag if you tell me please, ho
She gon' throw that ass back, drop that on them real niggas
I'm gon' throw that cash back, drop that on the real bitches
Murder on that pussy, ho, I kill-I-I kill bitches
You gon' get like every bag and every shoe if I deal with you
Young nigga ballin' like I fuckin' hit the lottery
You just want the money shorty, you ain't got to lie to me
All these niggas hatin' on me, know they wanna body me
'Cause every time you see a nigga, I look like a robbery

Tonight we'll slide to the future, have the time of our lives
In one night, every night, for the rest of our lives
We're hovercraft fly, lookin' down at the stars
You ain't ever been this fly before
Party like it's '94
And get twisted

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
This a new world, no rules
Hop in my spaceship and let's cruise
See the whole galaxy like we on shrooms
Burnin' all the gas, might get high off the fumes
A couple more toasts of these damn mimosas
I leave her legs spread like she fuckin' Moses
I leave her back bent a lil' scoliosis
Liftoff, hit the perc, hope I don't swerve
Mayday, mayday
Make a lil' cheese, your pockets need to gain weight
We gon' to the stars, I took her on a play date
Where they're speakin' a language that nobody can translate
She see the Earth then froze
If you scared of heights, then baby keep them eyes closed
Feelin' like Biggie cause this money ain't a thing
Might need more champagne so niggas can make it rain

Workin' all weekend so I might blow
Don't worry 'bout it, even if the light's low
Cause I threw on the 'Giela like a light show
I need more bottles, more flames
More with my whole gang
I do it cause we do it
Buy everything that we all drink
It's strange when your niggas turn fake
A dime never weigh another weight
Models on models, they 'bout it, 'bout it

Fuck I'm out my mind, I'm burning bread
So much let's have a toast
'Cause my niggas and momma know
If I wasn't here, nigga I'd be dead (Straight up)
Now I'm in the building thinking billions
Counting millions, what a feeling
Remember when I never ever made shit?
Now me and my niggas rocking chains (Straight up)
And whipping slave ships

Look, y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I've got a bunch of bitches tryna fuck with me
I'm unsociable with like most of them
'Cause I don't socialize where them suckers be
Lyrically I will demolish
This is the nail in the coffin, niggas is soft
Niggas remind me of nails at a spa
So under-polished, novices
They barkin' up the wrong tree (Double M)
Trust me if you with me then you goin' eat
I got them sweatin' like these bitches herein all day
And I'm off Atlantic, 2-1 rob 'em, bumbaclot, nigga
Not a P-O-K, I'm out for the VS
Get lifted, few zips like a Steep Tech
Use piff, short words for the loose girls
All mine's re-up, y'all regret
Don't worry 'bout my team, my team is set
Don't worry 'bout T, it's in-depth
When it comes to the mothafuckin' C-notes
We'll start us a mothafuckin' glee club
God damn...

We waited so long for this, to transform like I'm optimus
Monogamy for monogamous, ironically don't have time for this
The education brought scholarships
All the street taught us was to be streetwalkers
Full of hype and the life of a cheap talker
So tonight don't have no excuse not to take these offer
Now its time to make these suffer
Break out the bread and the wine and make E supper
Feel like a Pharaoh in his prime call that de-mumma
Momma, please don't trip on these trees at least none of these fuck ya
In the mindset of the greatest
Put that I'm a young Houston legend in the making
Grab your cameras Ima photo to be taking
Let the lights down tell them pipe down

So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So let's rule the world tonight don't worry will show off

Man, man, man, momma be trippin'
See Tony got the Jeep and I'm ready to whip it
Chase packin' the techniques, and we rockin' the Key Club
Roll up the dub, club showin' us love
You know nobody givin' a fuck, can't fit in the truck
All my homies is here, so tell me who rollin' with us
From Chicago to Houston, to NY, yeah, we do this
We bumpin' the music, so get drunk and get stupid
You know nobody givin' a fuck 'bout (Last night)

If you don't give a fuck about (If you don't give a fuck about)

Two twins and they naughty, they both ridin' shotty
It's a Friday and you know we ready to party
We hit the college in Malibu where it's hotties
They givin' us knowledge and while I'm drivin' they daddy's 'Raris
In the dark with no worries, we ain't in a hurry
I might just swerve and hit the curb (Skrrt)
We all too drunk to be scared (Skrrt)
Outta here, higher then the atmosphere
Yeah they ballin', but no Spalding
Make a killin', but no coffin
And when we make it, we gonna puke all over Vegas
And we were under the influence when we made this
So you gonna tell your DJ, ""DJ, DJ, play this"" (Last night)

It's the vendetta
No tarot cards, could tell me we trendsetters
Everybody out tonight, it couldn't have been better
Ain't nobody fight tonight except for the bartenders
We threw up our mom's dinner
So tell what you tryin' to do?
Me and my homies got the loot so we tryin' to boot
Her and her breast full off the booze, it's a party for two
Hotel room numbers and late night food runners
Summary of the whole summer, but can't seem to remember
From the fall of September, most of we can't remember
From the Spring to the Winter, couldn't tell you my dinner
Wish I could tell you what I did back in my past life
So how the hell you think I could tell you 'bout last night? (Last night)

I'm riding up uptown (Woo)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfucking monster (Woo)
You riding up uptown (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
At the green light I'm speeding
Fourth wheel on, I'm weaving
I got red eyes and swag seizures
All my concerts filling them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank
And a little more drank than La Flame might need
Tito Puente with the candy top
Fuck around, make the Latinas pop (Hmm)
It's a new world order (Hmm)
Never had my head on my shoulders (Huh)
Beware of the monsters
Ain't that what your preacher told ya? (Uh)
La Flame, 500 degrees
From the uptown to the Magnolia

I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)

Damn you gorgeous, tell me something I don't know
Dice on the corner with the lights low
Got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0
Damn you conscious
Gon' get your head off the plate though
Let me show you lil' Yamamoto
Take a little lick of the mayo
Out on 135th, spending them pesos
Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked
'Cause we got a little bit of Tango (Yeah)
Real nigga from the South to the East they feel a nigga
Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait
Take a little taste, leave you numb feeling in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weekend hell
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill (Um)
Chain links, by nigga, popular demand nigga
My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga
She can ride the dick no hands (Uh)

Pockets full of Benji Franklins, teacher, stay in line
Cannot take a break, in time, I'll take ya shine
Take your bitch, hit it from the back, I'll break her spine
I'm a lady, your bitch look like Shanaynay
Margiela so cold feel like Tommy gettin' his payday
Going nuts like a Payday, bitches thinking I'm crazy

Fuck I lost my mind
I've been runnin' since a quarter eight on the dirt road straight out The Mo'
Flip the bird 'fore a nigga faint
Fuck moms think a nigga strung on dope, niggas thinkin' I can't
Shit you wanna know me?
Let me show your ass a little thing
Every time I walk in this bitch, fresh, feeling my fir for the fish
She want to hold a nigga dick for the piss
To the squat for the flick
Give me yo thoughts for a bit
Right, gon' hit the weed, gon' head just cough little bit
Cum in her mouth, couple kids lost, coulda been a good spouse

Bad Mood / Shit on You,rap,travis scott,2013,144885,"[Part 1: Bad Mood]

[Verse 1]
(I just have one question) Fuck outta my business
I did things that most men will ask forgiveness
Broke the code, the commandments from my descendants
Who gives a fuck? New children in the buildin'
We ride with no limits
Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish?
I'm in a bad mood

[Verse 2]
Rob that dude, fuck that couch, burn that house
We the cause of the era, new niggas with new terror
A thousand on the leather, you niggas should know better
We niggas new slaves, I do say (Fuck, fuck)
Twice only on a Tuesday when I'm in a bad mood
Oooh, your skin mahogany (Fuck, Fuck)
Oooh, let's break the monotony
Government threw us in a maze (What?)
Had me trickin' 40k for some grades (What?)
Just to make 40k for the wage
Dropped out and made that in one day
I'm in a bad mood
[Verse 3]
Ooh, nigga I'm wildin' on 'em, back pilin' on 'em (Pilin' on 'em)
I never feel the pain, only God can make it rain (Make it rain)
So I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah
Kid of a disciple, these thoughts is suicidal
Jumpin' off a buildin', quit thinkin' like a psycho
They tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty
Anxiety, after the meds, Kris Bobbi (Uh)

[Verse 4]
Skinny black bastard ridin' a Casper (Casper)
I tend to lose my thoughts when I walk (Walk)
They say I'm a slave so tell me the master
Now his head on the pendant by the cross (By the cross)
Coke'd it then I fucked her for the theory
You know I'm crazy, I'm straight, no weary (No weary)
I hate when conversates can't relate
You know it be fucking up my groove when I'm in a bad mood

[Part 2: Shit on You]

[Bridge]
I can't wait... I can't wait... just to shit on you...

[Verse 5]
This one for the fuck fake niggas
That love to just hate, dog
Always talkin' that wild shit (Wild shit)
See 'em never let them verbs off (Verbs off)
All these fuckin' missed calls
Might delete the whole call log (Call off)
Thousand dollars for the jeans, fam
She grip 'em when a nigga swerve off (Yeah)
Think I need a desert eagle, niggas in my face (My face)
Thinking they know Jacques, niggas don't know me
Grew up on my lonestar, niggas roll that weed
(Niggas roll that, niggas roll that, niggas roll that weed)
[Chorus]
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
Just to shit on you
I can't wait, just to shit on you
(But why, Travis?)
Yeah, I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
Just to shit on you
I can't wait, just to shit on you

Our first kiss in the livin' room

A hella way to end the night
We did drugs in the bedroom (Bedroom)
That's a hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night

All you see is mountain and clouds, can't hit the brakes (Brakes)
She hit me twice in the face, there goes the base
She like to lift her nylon skirt to show the lace (Lace)
She say she love me but don't know what love is
I lost love 'cause my daddy said it but ain't ever done shit
Pain is love and love is hell (Uh)
I might need some bail if this shit don't sell (Sell)
Hand on my dick while I'm coastin' up the Fiji
Slow motionin' through emotion, tint in case a nigga see me
They'll come and feed you but that felt a little easy
I brought the squeegee case it get a little greasy (Greasy)
After a moment I fell into the mist
She reminisce a nigga style, God damn a nigga rich (Rich)
Wine and cigarettes under a light
Said she lost that angel done turned into a hell of a night (Night)

Lifted, I'm feelin' so gifted, trippin', I'm constantly fallin'
Channel view of the whole villa, plottin' while burnin' a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whippin' the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam
Whippin' trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway
For the line, listen, pimpin'
Your bitch just might physic my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele
Left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth
I copped it but now I don't miss it
Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin'
In fact that nigga prolly missin'

Blowed, Scott La Flame, pimp with no cane
Rockin' a robe in your hood with no pass
Fuck up the flow, nothin' but fam 'cause niggas be hoes
You can have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ
When I stock it up and then rack it up and then go
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs
My nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho house
Spillin' booze where the Barbie at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga
Take a picture of somethin', where your Kodak at?

Dance on the Moon,rap,travis scott,2013,69023,"[Intro: Theophilus London]
Where the weather is warm

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn't working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can't wait
In the moonlight, you can't see my eyes
And when I'm off the things I can't think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can't choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, 'cause the bills they was overdue
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you don't wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I'm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon' cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy 'cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can't be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it can't fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
I'm headed to the moon 'cause the world screwed up
Like the city, I grew up so
I'm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D, I'm full when I'm on E, you don't know nothing 'bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ain't no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit

Escaping through the night
Look into my night, my thoughts
Naked in this cruel world

Tears dripping on my pillow, thoughts is in my head
See my dreams jump out my window, if I follow I'll be dead
And I been waiting all week to talk this shit but instead
Gon' have to burn this roof down for these niggas to understand
And what we fucking for? For the lights in the night
The way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight
Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols
I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner
You can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga
I mean like every time a nigga blink I'm throwing on the mink
And she don't want to dance unless she drink
Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?

Rolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E

NIGHT Remix,rap,travis scott,2020,1842,"[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rockstars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll fuck up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind X2

[Hook]
But the nights keep fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey X2

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Summer time was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with will&rich and kwazi motos
So we popped the champagne so drunk spilled liquor all over her vera wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here
[Hook]

[Verse 3: QuiZzY]
White girls lying to their mum for the lines
Black boys do the crimes for the lines
You dealing or buying or you're way out of line
We be speaking to the tyrants that be twinkling and shinin
Bitches crying rivers cuz I left em behind
Got that liquor in my liver while I trip and recline
This bitch keep callin but im clicking decline
We live in a time,where the shit in our mind
Is to get on our grind,im ruthless for the paper
I spit the truth in the booth,and I ain't care about a hater
Plus im getting high, got a pack of northern lights
My sword is bright,ive sworn to fight as the warrior night
To protect those who sold their souls over night
So if you get in our way you will get pulverized
Im a monster, you better run bitch
You lucky that the night is over, see you at sunset

I dozed off in this cabin
Damn, I woke up barely breathing
Damn, I can't believe what I'm seeing, bitch from last weekend
We all met up for drinks and
She standing same coat, still chiefing on that pinewood
I'm tryna' figure how I end up in these dry woods
About as high as I was, no clothes and I'm tied up
Look like life or death, and she staring me in eyes
So I had to wipe my eyes cause this shit ain't gone fly
So I had to go, broke out then I clocked out now it's time to roll
Should have know I shouldn't have boned but I had the dough
When I pulled out all the weed she pulled out the blow

We took trips down to Marrows even shopped up at Meadows
She moved straight out the ghetto cause she deep down in that hell hole
Scholarships, daddy even let her drive all kind of whips
That's why I hear tire screeching
Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
I feel like she right behind me
But that ass might be outside
See all this gold right behind me, now that shit ain't no mirage
And she crazy like she Fonzy cause I won't have no menage
When I see me on the concrete man I swear I almost died
Somehow I jumped straight out my car seat not even I parked that shit outside
That bitch had me running down a dark street
How I made it out alive I don't know I must be slonky
How I know, now now I know

Whoa, she move the nigga aside cause he ain't important
She turn that
Cigarette to ash and watch it hit the dust
Girl quit playing yeah you know that nigga boring
Not too many in leather pants that can fuck with us
Now let us dance while I throw the dust
Ashes, to dust to dust
Know they all throw they hands cause they fuck with us
So many bitches bob and weave but they don't bob enough
Now these bitches mad look what I done started up
Put that whip outside, I hit the key it started up
I told them kiss my ass while I hit the dust
I hit the weed then I hit the gas
So much gold you think a nigga broke
So we gon' pull of trunk first so that you niggas know
With an Irish centerfold but all she know is Adido
Damn my momma proud a nigga made it out the moat
Where the sun always shine yeah but not no more

Remember when my niggas told me them owls came out at night
So now we bout to touch the sky, just to play in the night
Caught me standing now I'm in there standing, we staying the night
Daddy left but that nigga never said goodnight
Man that wasn't right, now I want all the power
Expected a lot from that coward
And any second I'm bound to wow ya, all them beats I dealt
For like two years momma all them beats I felt
I can massage my own dick I don't need your help
And I can crash my own whip, I don't need your belt
Tell me where the fuck was you when I couldn't feed myself
And all that wack shit help me be myself

Different know from my homies, talk like you don’t know me
Damn its gonna cost tomorrow, all them drunk flicks you wanna show me
Funny how we back here, all my fam here
Twisting up while we rolling up with a wine glass on a glass pier
Went from sleeping at Tony home, moving back to where I was grown
Trippy how
A nigga lifestyle makes me live my life wrong

Overnight just over night, I slipped into a cardiac
Slipped out my conscious don't know if I'm coming back, young maniac
Might go burn a roof, or what I'm supposed to do
Your rolling loner, walking living proof
A victim of the youth
Can I last one more hour?
Can you last one more night, cause I can make it
I ain't crazy, ain't need no doctor, I need patience
They be like ""boy there, where yah been?""
I been and made it, swear I been ablazing, swear I been amazing
Godly feeling, bad bitches, silicone-a-feeling
Let me cop a feeling, dream fulfilling
Tryna remix a million and build a building, gah damn!
I need that Neptune Estate that's out in the Hamps!
You know last night was so crazy, that shit went HAM!
Me and Archie, 10 bitches in a 2 seater
He can't remember nigga, and me either
Ahh!
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside

I can stay in your mind
Wish me to stay away
But no sign tells me to stay, when others say
Dear brother
Can you tell that this faith is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Can you tell that this face is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tell me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind

Down, she was down when I rode Impalas (Slay)
Played with her pussy in the Jeep
Yeah, she was down with the foreplay drivin' (Oh no)
Jumped in the car when she hit my digits
Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects (Skrrt)
Easy to me, my nigga
Villa with a scene, youngin always seen with a killer (Straight up)
Hand-stitched by my dealer
Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean Margiela?
She even got the 'scripts for the cough
In the H gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swerved off
Ain't it been a minute since they seen a weird nigga from the corner put it on for the south? (Straight up)
On my mama, know a nigga be coastin' (Bless up)
Go, nigga, go, nigga, grab my bottles
Go, nigga, go, nigga, grab my chronic (That go)

Bitch, don't you play me, don't you try me
I need the exact amount
Look at my face, ho, eye-to-eye me
I'm a boss, make sure you and your homies dress up, tight attire
When you see me, ho, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it
I mean, goddamn, nigga
You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from
Where you can't come, where it ain't none
Where these bitches is bitches and they ain't nuns
Where they hate from
But as soon as you blow, they act like they been down since day one
Where there's fuckin' tank guns
But niggas never join the army, like it ain't one
If I ain't got it, then I'm huntin'
I'm either countin' or I'm cummin'
Swear I just done bought that mansion
Treat that shit like it's a dungeon
Up at 5 A.M., still workin', but I treat it like it's one
I'm never actin' like I got it
Bitch, I'm actin' like I won it on these niggas

Walked in this bitch, I just got through finessin' designer (Straight up)
Oh my God it's no rental, gold plated, no need to remind you
Robbed my plug, that nigga wasn't getting me high (That dope)
Oh no no, oh no no no no no no no
Stack on black as True Religion (Straight up)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Man, here it go, fishcale, A1 perico
Fill PJ's up with kilos, then sell it like it's legal, yeah
Everybody he know, could have gotten hit with the RICO
Caught a couple of charges, they were weak though
Feds had to let him go in a week or so
Still, still need the key to blow
Whole heap of dough, ran the streets for so long
Man, the team was so on, damn, it seem like so long
Ago, we had 'em in Mexico
He tryna' make it back, three bricks more
The people always run up on us in Texas though
Only by the grace of God they ain't catch us though
Some lil' young nigga with some big dreams
Almost on the verge of doing some big things
Tryna' get a bird since he was sixteen
And now he playin' ‘round with fifteen or more, ayy
You know a nigga love nice things (Nice things)
And the price in the hood is too frightening
Them niggas ain't gon' do the right thing
It’s time for me to do my thing (Hey)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
This the last days to the rodeo
Last night had me down in the back, comatose
Don't think sunshades and a pill gon' help
Once I'm gone, can't tame myself (Myself, myself)
Mamacita, 'cita, 'cita
You know I really need ya, need ya, need ya right now
She get freaky when the light's down
The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down
With the head first, got her straight out of the nightgown
Nothin' like the light-skinned mamacitas in H-Town
They got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it, 3D money, no illusion
Depending if I'm feelin' bougie, might hit your line, bitch

Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper (Brrr)

She see me pull up in that 'Rari
I'm thinkin' 'bout choppin' the toppy (Chop the top, skrrt)
Got bitches on bitches, they run 'round the lobby
They know that I got it (Ooh, go)
I got too much money signs, sorry, can't fit in my wallet (No)
Sloppy toppy, you can't touch my wallet (Sloppy top)
Sloppy toppy, know the bitches got it (Woo, oh)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Brrt, hello?

Now they want a double dutch in my pockets (Straight up, yeah, yeah)
Tell me one thing, is you 'bout it? (Is you 'bout it?)
Girl, is you 'bout it? (Lil' bitty bitch, is you 'bout it?)
Gotta know before we let you tiptoe and run through the lobby (Run through the lobby, fuck is you sayin'?)
But the little bitty told me sloppy toppy was a hobby (Damn, damn, straight up)
So she gave me sloppy toppy like the sloppy toppy goddess (Like the sloppy toppy goddess, slop, slop)
Over the garden (Over the garden, slop)
Over the garden (Over the garden, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, what a goddess
On my province, we don't do massages (Straight up), just ménages (Oh)
She like to talk shit when we fuck, after she claims she forgot it (Straight up)
She don't tap out, no tap out, she'd rather just black out
Then we take trips to her trap house
We been pullin' them stacks out
Call over your friends, bend over, they poppin' for bands
Can't stop if I can
No, I do not do beer cans, fuck is this, frat house?

[Bridge: Travis Scott & Quavo]

I know that she bad (Bad)
And I know that the head is so good when she got around (Ooh)

My pockets so sloppy (Sloppy top, woo)
I pull out the whopper (Rrah), the chopper
Just know that's who shot ya (Uh, who?)

She hop in the whip, disappear like a genie (Go)

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
She got the sloppy toppy (Ugh), bitches want my broccoli

Them twitter bitches wanna follow me
I make 'em swallow me then kick 'em off of my property
Paparazzi keep on stalkin' me (Flash)
Feel like the Federali's keep on watchin' me (12)
Worth a hundred mill', niggas can't talk to me (Hundred mill')
Get sloppy toppy, but you givin' currency (Egh)
I make your bitch work for me, she at the DoubleTree (Bitch)
Chopping strong, OG gas bags of that Hercules (Bag)
Removing the top off the Audi, do surgery (Ayy, ayy)
Red on the bottom of my shoes, it's a murder scene
I don't want your bitch, she a nat-nat (Nat)
Pull up in the Audi, it's a hatchback (Hatchback)

Boogers in my Rollie, Pikachu yellow (Brr, ugh)
Pick a shoe, Balenci, Maison Margiela
Pick a big bezel, which bezel is better? (Which bezel is better?)
My jeweler know I got big cheddar (Bag)
Double Lambo, double parking wherever (Ooh)

Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor
Still rollin' up Swishers
Now it's Bimmers double parking, fuck payin' the meter
In your club, on your couches, got paid to be here
On your girl rubbin' on my favorite features
How could they tease us? Only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas

Bad mamacita, Miami Heat her, put her in a two-seater
Too bad I couldn't three-peat her
Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper

No matter what time, the skies are grey, ooh

Might be the last time I trip
I know I said this shit last time
But damn I never had a trip like this
Who knew a threeway on freeway can trip
With three hoes to a six-way?
Ain't gotta finesse out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that Ben-Gay
No more, goddamn
And Pops never gave me shit
But Pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where it looked so good outside
Like it ain't that serious
My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit
Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick
Killa tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious
Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous
The nigga so good, he was so cold

Tell me what you need, I got everything green
Money, money, money trees, I buy everything
That bitch need no wedding ring, she need a bean
That boy walked in mall, that boy he need a beam

We up all night, from dawn to dusk it's always poppin'

I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat' above your crack
And on your cat, you be right back
Your momma never know
We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
I take that puff, you take that puff
You know we never care to overdose

[Verse 1]
Uh, by the bar (Bar), buy the bar
Bitches on my table everywhere (Where)
On the floor, condoms on my dresser (Straight up)
On my business, never plannin'
Never sober (La Flame), thinkin' blew me up (Up)
Body shots took on your bitches titties
Slow it down, pick it up, fuck a third
Speed the fourth gear grindin' up
On everything, it's my year (Straight up)
I got it now, everything I ever asked for
We gettin' it, far from mama's Jeep
She never tinted it
She frozed up, I unfrozed her
Now come a little closer (Straight up)
Get your ass up off that wall
And go roll up that doja (That dough)
Tell your boyfriend bust that key
Go 'head and fill ya nose up (La Flame)
'Til it's over
We ain't lookin' for the hoes, where the trophies?
Grab a glass, go ahead, get throwed up (Straight up) (Yeh, yeh)
She feelin' it (Yeah, yeh, yeh)
Don't spill the shit (Yeh, yeh)
Ah, she crazy, she goin', she goin'
Gone!

Ayy, all this money on the table, ooh
We don't want relations
We don't want no conversations
Fuck around and change the weather (Straight up)
Damn, I'm with my main bitch
Ayy, and I don't love her no mo' (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Drinkin', fuck the limitations
I done made it out the basement
Fuck around and change the weather (Straight up)

I'm off a bean, I'm off a bean
See this lean, it's in my dreams (That dope)
Off this dope, don't wanna smoke (Oh no)
Off this roll, I might just roll (Straight up, straight up)
Let's get throwed
Out in Houston they know my name (Oh)
In MO city they know the gang (Oh)
Young La Flame, ain't nothin' changed
But the chains and diamond rings

[Verse 2]
Diamond rings, I lost my brains
Me and Ye Ye out in broad day
I'm on the 3rd coast
Eatin' Burlow with Merlot (Straight up)
I got my shirt off
Kickin' dirt off out in Bergdorf (La Flame)
She like, ""What you doin'?"" (Doin')
It took a path just to get me here
Don't give a damn if that's ruined (Ruined)
Later on got a ring, ring, ring
She at my doorbell, ""ding-ding-ding-ding""
Let the bitch in, the bitch seen
Bang out, bang out
On the couch, on the floor, in her mouth
Camera's out (Camera's out)
Once my dick's in, no pulling out (No pulling out)

That's my baby (Straight up)
Bitch been doing coke since the '80s (That dope)

Backyard,rap,travis scott,2014,251502,"[Intro]
Aight, play the shit
Yuh, yuh, yuh

[Verse 1]
Gon' grab that fifth, grab that eighth, grab what you need
Blow that dope, don't get too high
From the Third Coast to the West Coast, come, take this ride
Let me tell the tale of how Jacques turned Scott
Over one lost trip to the sky
Let me tell the tale 'cause you told the tale
When you said I could make it this high
Who knew?
Goddammit, who knew?
The grass ain't greener on the other side, it's just blue
You can really identify when you lookin' in your eyes
You ready to ride, that's true
When they look in my eyes, they see that real
How Scotty entired that juice, had my back against that wall
Every summer felt so cold, my daddy ain't comin' home 'til Fall
That's why my pimp game so moist, had that du-rag and all
Had a 20-year-old bitch in high school
Wasn't no tellin' what Travy might do
On the south side of that H-O-U...
Hol' up, let's take it back to that room, no car but still had drive
Just a hundred niggas standin' outside
Life's a beach with lot of sand on the lot
I'ma ride for all of my niggas, they forever here by my side
It was just eight niggas in a two bedroom, no leg room, that was last June, yeah, yeah, for real
[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, for real
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout me, nigga
Let it be known, yeah, it's that real, yeah, yeah, for real, for real
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout
We them niggas everybody talkin' 'bout, it's that real, yeah, for real

[Chorus]
Backyard, we chillin', backyard, we drinkin', smokin'
Homie brought out the liquor, backyard, we gettin' high
Back-backyard, we chillin', back-backyard, we smokin', drinkin'
Back-backyard, we gettin' high, backyard, we chillin'
Backyard, we drinkin', smokin', homie brought out the liquor
Backyard, we gettin' high, back-backyard, we chillin'
Back-backyard, we smokin', drinkin', back-backyard, we gettin' high

[Verse 2]
Verses, one day you'll find your purpose
Now, my show's packed out like churches
Fans never missin' out a word on the verses
Never sit around, just workin', it was worth it
That's for certain, I deserve it
Lord knows we don't get tired, been through more dirt than a derby
Mama worked for AT&T, and we still ain't get that service
She stayed in/out the hospital, you know that made me nervous
Still step out the house to smell so fresh, fresh like detergent
If a bitch don't want me, don't need them still got my Jergens
And bitch, you can keep them herpes, go alert me
No house light on, cop light on, fuck this journey
You heard me, you heard me, now, swervin', hittin' curbs
And my nigga, my nigga came home so it just got real
[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, for real, yeah, yeah, for real
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout me, nigga
Let it be known, yeah, it's that real, yeah, yeah, for real, for real

Tens, I never get it, money is plenty
On a billion dollar mind scheme, on the rhyme scheme

Dressed here, with the retro, might pull up on your show Trillelectro
Might hit the Amsterdam with the mess low

I'm looking at your girl, thats my bitch!
You took her out now, she living with (me)
I ain't rolling through, with written shit
This is straight flow, waking up at the 9AM, blowing dope

Hotel at my door, like ""you gotta go,""
I ain't leaving 'til 4, yeah you gotta know

He the first nigga showed me duffle bag with millie
Nigga put me in a Bentley, nigga blowing Philly
Had me out in Philly, after Wet Willies
Took 'em to Miami, took 'em to damn Diddy
Out on the boat rolling, I'm sipping on wet willies
Once again no Ciroc, I'm moving, I'm moving good
Shout my nigga Ye, we all G.O.O.D

Sometimes I, Sometimes I drive

Sometimes I drive, sometimes I

Feel like I'm, feel like I'm (on the drive to the moon)

Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn the devil stay testin' and the devil wear Prada (Just trynna go up an avenue)
Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
Be rockin' furs, look like copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours I just stared at the stars
Look with my eyes closed cause it's driving me wild
[Bridge: Travi$ Scott]
Hit the weed and just drive (just drive)
Hit the weed and just drive (just drive)

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive

[Verse 2: Matt Healy]
I hit the weed and just drive
Never fucked around so I’ll be alright
And you can sit around here fucking with smaller minds than mine, live your life
She said the air is so clean
I think it was the codeine
But she thinks it's just trees
I like it when you stroke me
Eighteen, eighteen bitch
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
She likes to take LSD
Searching mathematical purity
Travel with security
Smokin' in the wind
Losing all my friends, smokin' in the wind
She said I'm feeling so lean, I think you called it codeine
Now her heads on their knees
I like it when you blow me
Eighteen, eighteen bitch
Bitch,  don't smoke all my weed
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed

So fucking tired so fucking many nights it got so hot in there
So tonight we at the time nigga blow them candles mane
Cause when its time to shine no need for candles mane
We some cocky niggas in the rocky niggas
Rocking dolo Will & Rich in here we from the traffic nigga
See the problem is yeah, we too proud of this
Now-now, the problem is, too many columns is anonymous
We too proper nigga get a prop for this
And we can take a trip to Karen nigga get a shot of this
Dodge a copper-opper cab will give a shit
Go to class but not for the scholarship
Here's a different scholar she a dolly pouter
Here's a problem with my holy grail, ain't got no holy water
I'm too slonky, Tony hates this part about it
When the keys roll up the car, you can roll if you with it yeah, yeah

Mirror mirror, on the wall, who the freshest of em all? Tell em
That shit is wack, them niggas in the mall they sellin'
Think about it, she stay in the Margiela
Trippy done slip on the floor, bout 4 of my bros
Stepping these hoes, vanilla

Candy be keep tapping that hoe, we hopping that area code
Somehow, if they figure that Harry and Mary are bros
They end up just rocking the tote
Circles around, you be calling up everything gold
Them niggas is southerners niggas be rapping and popping
Not give a fuck about those
The same ones giving me 5, is seeing me live
The girl they chilling beside, be giving me sage
She been tripping all night, thinking 'bout moving them boobies aside
Sneak in and out of the crib
But definitely, Holly committed to giving me rights

Cigs? It's her birthday

Or just, anything
Jordan?

On the back when a lil' nigga had to sit and deal with it
Loner turned rock star, nigga, under the moon
Got the world in my palm, 'bout to rub her pussy with it

Ain't no recession bitch, ain't got collections bitch
I don't respect the bitch, I might say fuck the bitch
And then go and fuck the bitch, I'm seein' a psychiatrist
The devil inside me, and I'm tryna hide it
This lean got me nauseous, but I keep on usin' it
I wear so much Givenchy, that they say I'm abusin' it
I went and tried to sit down with the Pope
And tell him I was usin' too much dope
The only way I tell him anything, he gotta plug me in with the coke

Never Catch Me,rap,travis scott,2015,187994,"[Verse]
She take a shot of Hennessy
I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up
I do this shit for him and me
I'm the next lone star to blow-up
Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats 'cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The RAV4 turned into a Rover
'Til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on?
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat-all-day; itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it
[Chorus]
No, no, no, no
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies?
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing:
They will never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off
Falling off, never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off

You niggas some marks and you ain't got no heart
I know lil' one gon' come with that A and that R
(Only trill niggas I know)
I know lil' one gon' come with that A and that R
I'm counting, I'm dripping, I'm fiending
I'm not from this planet, I was abandoned
Trill niggas, real niggas, popping them pill niggas
Stack up a mil', nigga like it's a lil' nigga
This for the one who gon' load up that K for me
This for the ones that ran off and didn't wait on me
This for the niggas ran off and didn't wait on me
This for you, bitch, you ran off and didn't wait on me
(Only trill niggas I know)
Hood nigga, fuck all that red carpet shit
Hood nigga, I fuck a red carpet bitch

You can smell promethazine when I piss
I pray to God he bring me Actavis
Ain't nobody triller than Metro, ain't nobody triller than Scooter
Hop on the private, I do it, take all the mollies, I do it
The Bentley put up with no mileage, I do it
These Styrofoams with me legitimate
I'm proudly downing these Percocets
We just want to be stoners lately, I've been on, on, on
This money an option, this weed is an option, this lean is an option
Your bitch is an option, her bitch is an option
I send them through auctions
You paying that price for that punani
This gold on my neck is a new Grammy

Maybach in the living room (Ooh)
I spent racks on these tennis shoes (Tell 'em)
Niggas know what I'm finna do
Time for me to put the mink up (I did)
Forgiattos on the Brinks truck
My favorite rapper drove a pink truck (Killa)
I do shit that you dreamed of

Drinkin' breast milk out a lean cup

If she bad as hell I'll pay the babysitter (I will!)
In a black Mercedes with her (Skrrt)

I was born a hustler, paraphernalia in my baby pictures
Resident, all elegant (Elegant)
Leather shit in my front yard (Swear)

Got that built like a sports bar (Ayy)
Chevelle with a new motor (Err)
Got the bitch like a sports car (Yeah)
Yeah, my name is Tity Boi (Oh)

Pornography,rap,travis scott,2015,667054,"[Intro: T.I.]
Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of ""Fuck this shit""
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you, and fuck this

[Chorus]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights—, lights—, lights—
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy
[Verse 1]
You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut

[Chorus]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Interlude: T.I.]
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say ""Fuck you""
To the ones who said ""Fuck you""
'Til you doing ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
""La Flame,"" he hears in his head, ""The world is yours"" (Yours, yours)
[Refrain]
Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

[Verse 2]
It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium
[Refrain]
So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

I've been taking risks to make that money flip, shots to the head
I ain't order it, I can't afford this shit
Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit
Now, it's pay up player, pay a nigga
Gotta day to day to stack and still I pay accountants
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance
Only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, coming down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them wit-it boys stay wit-wit-wit it
I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan
Looking in the mirror like ""One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man""

Four shots now she wanna do the clique
Any more shots she ain't gon' remember shit
Smoking on extendos, no clips
Project hoes going up in the Ritz (Trippy)
She gon' do it for a G, anything for me, bruh
She just wanna fuck and drink and chief all the weed up
Sexy bitch, pop that pussy 'cause you in your prime
Pour that purple over ice, call it ""turtle time""
Shawty never been a hesitator
Got her going down on the elevator
Heard the pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her
Fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later
No magic trick, but I levitate her
With the magic stick, nothing less than great
When I hit her with the dope D, I'm gone
Don't text me later, no extra favors

I be flying high, can't you tell from my red eyes? (Hey)
Took a trip from Paris down to Houston for your apple pie (Oh-oh)

And they got that in they trunk (Hey)
Now turn around and show the world
How you shake that rumpty rump
Say it, we don't fuck with cops
Oh no, we don't fuck with cops (Hey)
In my backseat, I got four freaks
Who love how my speakers knock
Don't bring no sand to the beach
All we want is love and peace (Hey)
We'll find a girl to bring home
'Cause we about to take a flight to go be on, yeah
[Bridge: Toro y Moi]
(It's true)
It seems like flying's all I do

And I'll watch you go by (Get down)

Yeah, I can tell, baby, I can tell

[Verse 1]
I can tell by the night tales and the dry spells
All the wrong ones and the right things to stay away from
And how we took off and how we on top
And how we won't fall, how we going up
Or how we came up, or how we came up
It all started in the basement
Was an attic but we called that shit the basement
Bass used to break all my momma vases
Unc shot my first 8 then nigga I probably wasn't eight then
Always had the gas like I broke wind
They said my way of making dollars never made sense
Come take a dive, a waterfall in the deep end
I can tell you 'bout the nights out in Fort Bend

No, you don't tell, yeah-ah-ah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I can tell 'bout the night tales
And all the dry wells, and all the long roads
And all my ideas before the cornrows (Straight up)
How we came up and how we came down
Going donuts, coffee couldn't help now (La Flame)
How we zoned out, made it out the wood now
And what it do when they wanna be your friend now (Oh, no)
How to get it, how to live and get it in now
How to go from scraping pockets, making his demand now
I been impulsive, non-emotional, staying humble 'bout it (Yeah)
Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle (Yeah)
Five-o-four hot boys
Minus the bad rap like Silkk the Shocker (Yeah)
But I'ma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk
Nigga, you know I been a rocker, dripping milk and knockers
Take it up another notcher, take it up another notcher (Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
I top a, pop a pill, pop a seal to forget about ya
I'll bumbaclot you, bumba—bumba—blocka shot ya (Brrrat-brrrat-brrrat-brrrat-brrrat)
Bling and bang, a bang a rapper
Bangarang, I brought my money back
Orangutan diamonds hangin' on my neng-a-lang (Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
Bitches hanging on my dang-a-lang (Straight up)

Pray 4 Love,rap,travis scott,2015,660686,"[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh, oh, don't pray for love
Oh, oh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Weeknd]
Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating, might as well fuck up some shit
They looking at me way too crazy, got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix (Just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz (Just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh, oh, don't pray for love
Oh, oh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & The Weeknd]
Pills (Pills, pills), have you ever been through life's (Through life's), challenges? Promises? Promises? (Challenges? Promises? Promises?)
Get down, I'm prayin' (Get down, I'm prayin')
Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah
'Fore a nigga had the locks (Just ask the lonely)
'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch (Just ask the lonely)
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (Oh-oh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box
(Don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (Just ask the lonely)
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow (Just ask the lonely)
And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow
Pray for love
[Bridge: The Weeknd & Travis Scott]
No, oh, oh (Woah)
We don't pray for love, no more, no more (Woah, woah, woah)
We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton (You don't wanna see no more)
We don't wanna see you on the news (No more, no more, no more, no more), all alone
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no, hm, no, no, no, no, no, no (Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no (Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, yeah

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watching all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack, got me cooking all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she wanna be wifey
She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax, faster than a hi-hat
Sorry, baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke, boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no

Should have never let us niggas in
Got my first M 2012
Now a hundred K in the mail
Free another homie on bail
Money low, her pussy gon' sell
Tryna tell me money ain't shit
When you tried to tell me water won't whip
When you tried to say this quarter won't flip
Since Snoop who the other rich crip
How Groovy get the Pringle man chip
Walk on with a twenty-yard clip
Walk on while a real nigga limp
Black nigga green grass no golf
So on turn the satellite off from the set
Feel like I died on that cross, hang on

Never Catch Me Demo,rap,travis scott,2015,8363,"[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
She take a shot of Hennessy
I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up
I do this shit for him and me
I'm the next lone star to blow-up
Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The Rav4 turned into a Rover
Til' it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat all day, itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it

No, no, no, no
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies?
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing:
They will never catch me
Falling off, falling off (Never catch me)
Falling off, falling off (Never catch me)
Falling off, falling off (Never catch me)
Falling off, falling off

Turn a nigga flat line
Wannabe-trill nigga, nap time (Uh)

We don't want that here no more
Cause we don't wanna ride
I did it all on my own and I did it on time

Only you can fix inside
So if I make it out tonight
Let's make it a badass time

Okay, I got it, copy
20/20 but I can't see nobody
One eye open, Illuminati
This might be the verse that make 'em drop me
Ain't makin' friends, we just makin' hobbies (Yeah)
No, that wasn't my girl, that was just a hobby (Yeah, yeah)
Call up 50, tell 'em load up the lobby
Elevator up, no need to find me, yeah, yeah

Newspaper stand, we press the issue (Press it, press it, press the issue)
We ain't sendin' shots, we launchin' missiles (Yeah, right up at your hood up north)
Checkin' Third Ward, I'm goin' mental
Fuckin' up my room, I've been rackin' up incidentals
Cookin' on a tune, I've been cheffin' up instrumentals
Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the
When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat (Back seat, back seat, back seat, back seat)
Driver run the miles up like I'm runnin' a track meet (Track meet, track meet, track meet, track meet)
Gotta watch my back now, 'cause these niggas at me
All black in a Benz when I pull up on ya

To them I'm a big dick, a cheque and some laughter (Hahaha)

I gave up on the Bible long time ago, uh
Oh, I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know, ha
I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids, hmm
And dumped 'em in the creek up from where I live (Ayy)
Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around (Uh, uh)
We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around
Killer would show up with boxes of pizza, uh
And said he had a label recruitin' people (Uh)
Put that on my grandma and everything, yeah
My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne
It could've been me or could've been you too
But what a memory, it may need interludes (Could've been me)

So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too

That coca

[Chorus: NAV]
I just poured an eight in a liter
Throw some Jolly Rancher in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snortin' three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rollin' off molly
Got a white bitch snortin' up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (That coca)
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
[Verse 1: NAV]
I just poured an eight in a liter
With a white bitch sniffin' on Bieber
Are you sure you want to party with the demons?
Bitch lookin' for a phone, I ain't seen it
Told Frost bring the water, no Fiji
Free Stix, I'm poured up and I'm leanin'
I got a couple pussy niggas in their feelings
'Cause the main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more, your girl is a ho
You need to let go, she fucked all my bros
She snortin' the snow (That coca), now she's touchin' her toes
She got Anna Nicole all in her nose
If they kick down the door, we gon' get locked for sure
She said she want more, fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)

Snipe it, swipe it, rapper, trapper (Ooh, yeah)

White bitch (Bitch), she thick (Bitch)
Pulled out of the hood, Toyota
Drove back to the hood, Lambo' (Ooh)
Crushed Xans, crushed Xans in my soda
Ridin' around the city with my eyes closed (Yeah, yeah)
Crazy Girls got it poppin', AOD got it poppin' (Yeah, yeah)
Tryna text my accountant, ain't no service in the mountains (Straight up)
Won't you come to the bottom? Know you heard a lot about 'em (Yeah)
Heard they take that then they change like a mood ring (Yeah, yeah)
I watched 'em take that then they change like a mood ring

Don't like what I saw
This life without yours
Despite I was lost
Despite you got flaws
Just let our love play, its course
Let you tell it, what's mine is yours, what's yours is yours
All the signs I ignored
I play love like a sport

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Yeah, first date
You ain't on time, you were late (Yeah!)
When you around me, you're safe (Lit!)
You can't go off of a hearsay
I know that look on your face
You think you winnin' a race
You think all I do is play (Yeah!)
I didn't put you in your place
Then why you still here in my place?
Yeah, thought so, yeah, and also
You think too much, we all know
You think too much, we all know
Yeah, I ain't tryna go back to war with your morals (Yeah!)
You can't kill the vibe, it's immortal (Straight up!)

Wipe down your nose, girl

Let's both find hoes
Let's fuck them both
But you think too hard, we all know
You think too hard, we all know
So say nothin', nothin'
'Cause you think too hard, we all know
Yeah, you know I'd rather lead it than follow
You and me, baby, mano y mano (It's lit)

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Okay, lil' mama
I still ain't heard from lil' mama
We go back to Angliana when you was studying in college
But I called you and brought you out to Santa Monica
Believed in you, I was your sponsor
I got love for you, but I'm not in love
Gave me affection
Girl, I was lost, she gave me direction
Went through fuckin' you with no protection
All my blessings
Girl, you one of all my blessings
You think I don't care about you?
Girl, you better call my best friend
I got time to waste
Girl, I got time to waste
Girl, I cancelled everything
Just to get back on the same page
To finish the story
But you would rather ignore me
Your mama called to check on me
But you won't even pick up the phone, shit
God damn, you feelin' yourself
Out in Hollywood, you got a nigga with some wealth
You ain't free tonight, I bet he call somebody else
Tryna tell you I'm the last real nigga left
You can hit me if you need help
With your love problems, with your money problems
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em

Give me just what I need (straight up), ya, all them gon' ride for me
Go and bend down for me, never gon' cop a plea

'Member when I never ever made shit?
Now me and my niggas rocking chains and whipping slave ships

Travis gets a hotdog from hotdog stand, drives off and
Gets in a car accident

Playing instrumental to ""the ends""

Travis: Spoken
Dimness, my old brother
I can feel whispers flying over endless rain of meaningless chaos
Reality always exceed fiction
I can see an unborn generation
I can hear within the silence and see within the nothingness
Flashing neon lights trying to disturb and throw off my fucking judgment
Past, present, and future all melted in a nonending circle
Hear my words of temptation and redemption
They made me believe I could escape
Remember this shit, remember me, the one who die here
It's time to live

Playing ""coordinate""

Travis steps off the roof of an abandoned building to be found on the ground of an abandoned construction site

The power of nature is such that it's what all art strives to be

Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world

Dropped out and subtracted some niggas
And made more than my math teacher

Makin' trips to them dealers, guess it paid off nigga
Sip this wine in fine clarity
Marijuana, the youth therapy
Swervin' on my old hoes that drove to insanity
I guess that was all straight out of vanity
To my kids, that was plan to be
That was all, the inhumanity

Lucky I'm fresh, in the Dime fashion
A class act, called a class act
Funny, lookin' back, wonder where my class at

Wake up, bake up, hit the fridge, all I see is them breads
Cop lights, no lights, cause them bills it was overdue
Skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking walks to the side of the moon
Gotta take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, don’t wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I’m on some popular shit, come look in my eyes to get a fix
We just gon' cruise, hit the brews, don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
Got the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can’t be realer, me and my niggas by the villa
She in that white dress it can’t fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink it like she got no liver
I hit it and she on the moon my nigga
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

They peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn’t working out
Kiss my momma for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can’t wait
In the moonlight you can’t see my eyes
And when I’m off the things I can’t think
Damn I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can’t choke
When they recognize a real nigga skill
Ride with me, down with me, kept me afloat
Now all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse]
First order of business, I gotta fly out my people
Way too many fakes in my face, I can see the evils
Drug addictions, bad bitches
They gotta be chose, see the peacoat
Black slacks, it's R.I.P. clothes, see amigos
Laid back, I cock the nino, game time, gang time
No time to reload, handle mine, take mine
I've gotta deebo, can't waste a minute
Rap Yeats, I master business, but still a menace
Peep my mojo I got together, I'm in my bag
Too many looks, they pocket watchin', gotta hit the gas
Look back, I see the clouds, these niggas doubt
They say a nigga'd never make it, now look at me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hood times, I never cared, I pull up there
Outside your club, I'm at your club (yeah)

Yeah, ill America baby
Scott, La Flame
Ill America baby

[Verse 1]
Lifted, I'm feelin' so gifted, trippin', I'm constantly fallin'
Channel view of the whole villa, plottin' while burnin' a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whippin' the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, and Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam
Whippin' trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway
For the line, listen, pimpin'
Your bitch just might physic my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele
Left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth
I copped it but now I don't miss it
Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin'
In fact that nigga prolly missin'

[Verse 2]
Speedin', and damn I'm leanin' on a Kawasaki
In the lobby, then we 'dro codeinin', out in Abu Dhabi
Chain beamin', man, I hope you ain't anemic
Cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, it's just me and four women
And we all playin' hockey
Blowed, Scott La Flame, pimp with no cane
Rockin' a robe in your hood with no pass
Fuck up the flow, nothin' but fam cause niggas be hoes
You can have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ
When I stock it up and then go
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs
My nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho house
Spillin' booze where the Barbie at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga
Take a picture of somethin', where your Kodak at?
If Scottie ain't totin' or swimmin' in women
He writin', producin' and scorin' and filmin'

Cut the lights down low
Here comes this walking cloud of smoke
Why is he not never broke?
What is this, huh, some kind of joke?
This bag of weed will smoke out six states
I'm King Chip, nigga, ask yo' bitch how my dick tastes
I'm in these streets touring with a pound of trees
Smokers always surrounding me
Now these bitches houndin' me, wanna go outta town with me
Told this girl I only fuck two dimes at one time
So she came back with a 9.5, I said ""fine""
Fuck it, close enough, open up, let me plug up your socket
Keep some weed in my pocket in case you get out of pocket
Uh, we chilling by the pool and bitches wanna get higher
Told her my name was Chip and she told me I was a liar
I'm hot, bitch, I'm on fire, she don't even think I'm me
And I really do this shit, how the fuck you think I eat?
It's you and your girlfriend?
Cool, it's just me and Travis Scott
We just need some head we don't ask a lot, haha

Twenty drunk bitches around me
Toastin' up, this can't be life

Because I'm in the backseat with the cops surrounding me
Wonderin' what we did last night
But I'm pretty sure it was wild, wild

10 am, it’s Ransomnia
She see the dust, it's so obvious
Run from home, after tonight, we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
Fuck the streetlights, she ran the street tight
She run her mouth, but can't eat right?
Don't read between the lines and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby, you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
The Rollie on me only 'cause to tell what the time is
We lost in the city where sin is no biggy

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & MC E]
Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past, you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before, no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds (Alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed (Alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week (Alright, alright, alright)
Plus she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwin' up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah

Look at your Rollie, uh, look at my Rollie, uh
That's a small face, uh, this a big face, uh
She can't see my room, fuck her in the hallway
Gettin' bored with this money, count it all day

Yeah, they thought we were soft, boy, you learned the hard way
Not with all the talkin', turned it to a closed case
Look, pull up Sky Dweller, and it's vanilla
All white, that Plain Jane, yeah
The rose gold one better, hundred or better
I took the money and flooded my bezel
You diamond to rock, computed the settin'
VVS diamonds, they pop just like kettle
I popped a molly to get on my level
Rockin' that Ricky and Raf, here my sweater
Yeah, Patek Philippe, it cloudy like Heaven
Met her at 10, fucked that girl at 11
Fake diamonds in your Rollie, how you reckon?
Diamond tester, nigga, you better check it, yeah

Bust a bankroll in the club, where's Chase? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Angel in the snow (White)

Leave it on the floor but she's slidin' from the pole (What?)
Like woah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Really on speed (Yeah, cash)
You and ivory is all I need (Skrrt-skrrt)
All agreed, we gon' skip the tees, go bare like trees (Trees)
It's stuck in heat, link up with the dawgs and then we flee
Way this summer goin', I might start my summer league (League)
Every young nigga get a check and get a team

No small faces, it's just an AP beamin' (Yeah, yeah)

Your shit rockless, my shit hockey goalie
You should gon' hide it, man, it's too bad
Like a bald nigga still wearin' durags, ha
Israeli guards, boy, please be mindful
Don't have words with me 'cause I got a mind filled
I could tell Larry David was the mind behind Seinfeld
Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield
Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills
Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos
Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati, next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?
Never trust a bartender that don't drink, bitch

Now we on now like the light bill, but never cuttin' off, yeah
I'm on top now, still comin' down, but never fallin' off, yeah
I might need the distance, all I need is time, time
Can't even look at my phone line
Without a couple texts that I can't deny
Locked the phone, I had to close my eyes
Half the time, man, they tellin' lies
Who to trust? Man, I can't decide
Nowadays, we just don't reply
But they know my name, they compare it, still
We was busting seals before we had a mil'
We done had the grills before we had a deal
I'm a Houston nigga, that's what made me here

Hit you with that Bill Cosby, thirty bitches overnight

I might have to pull a Tiger, I might have to crash my ride
Can't be like you niggas, no, can't be like you guys
I can't tell no stories, no, I can't tell no lies
All we do is money, do that money exercise
We just pay our taxes, pay our tags, don't pay no mind

Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense

You feeling free in my absence

Too many doors closed, cul-de-sacs and fork roads (Ooh)
Still ended up at the North Pole

Fighting over your deeds, sliding over your keys (Ooh)

Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watchin' my soul

Said I'll be there in ten, but I got there in four

(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

To win the retreat, we all in too deep

To win the retreat, we all in too deep

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Make my own rules, I really don't pick, I just choose
I don't set picks, I just shoot
Chopped and get screwed

Put it on God, He the one that put me on top
Can't be put in a box, gotta move on the opps
Devil got the move on the drop
Niggas tryna move on the Scott

Nah, the dawgs ain't civilized, take the one, feel vilified

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said ""where we goin'?"" I said ""the moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's-it's 4 A.M and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Put the pussy on a pedestal (ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for

Only way to live, only live life is on dis side

You never pulled up on midnight, midnight
Midnight, midnight
You know I like my lean poured just right, just right
On dis side
You find everything you need, everything you need
Everything inbetween, I veil these jeans
I used to pull up on the mean, I used to pull up on the team
I gotta lo-lonely, got fours on a bomb bean

Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down

Whole crew, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Distant sky, from north of the border my chips is in order

Something's 'bout to pop up out of hidin'
I can see the darkness in your eyelids

I made a lot of money on this side
Lost a lot of money on this side
Had my first kiss on this side
Learned a lot of shit about this side
Lately I been thinking 'bout this side
Tryna get back on this side
Tryna get back what's been mine
I gotta get back on this side
Really miss the feelin' of the late nights
Shit we used to do around midnight
Hangin' on the corner, had shit tight
Doin' all the drugs, had to get right
If I could bring my partner back, it'd be nice
He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice
He was too involved with the street life
Only way to live on this side

Baby, I just left from Vegas
Did 'em dirty on the table
Went and bought a new Bentayga
I paid cash, don't see no paper
Buy it, park it, tint it later
All my cars' inside tomato
From Atlanta, not Decatur
I'm the one they say don't play with
Make them boys get on your tater
High-five LeBron, floor seat the Lakers
Get more paper, get more haters
Standin' still, my diamonds skatin'
Fucked her once, she think we datin'
I can spend it, I been savin'
I'ma spin ya, try to play me
I been trappin' up the millions, used to trap it off a RAZR
Back when I was sellin' two-for-five plays, called in my RAZR
Niggas never had to give it to me, I want it, I'ma take it
Guaranteed to tell a ho goodbye if she don't try to get naked

No matter what time, the skies are grey, ooh

[Verse 2]
That second verse, fresh to death, straight out a hearse
Can't do no verse, Lord knows-know I got a curse
Bitch, said fuck you bitch, bitch, damn you know I'm your man
Ass, ass, ass, yeah, it's fuck you, bitch
Clap, clap, clap, you know you bitch
Yeah, I'm speedin', Lambo two-[?]
Uh, you know we in it, you know
You know, retweetin' it, uh
Price scales, you beatin' it
Hotel bookin', you screen it
I go under to all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night like

[Chorus]
We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says the smell's too loud
Ridin' in my old school thang
Shotgun with my old school babe
So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey
No matter what time, the skies are grey, ooh

Did you have the time of your life?
Let's have the after party at my place
Do you have some spare change?
On me, I've got hundreds I'll throw in your face

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free, and wildin', order more kidneys

Dope, I'm so dope
All these hunnies pilin' on the floor
And we're stuntin', know you see the glo
Girl, these hundreds, thought I'd let you know
Since LA, I've been puttin' on
Cirque du Soleil, on and on and on
I got this money, tell me what you want
For this money, can you drop it low?

Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island

Hope I make it outta here

She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (Ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I'm doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)

When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Baby, I just left from Vegas
Did 'em dirty on the table
Went and bought a new Bentayga
I paid cash, don't see no paper
Buy a park and tint it later
All my cars inside tomato
From Atlanta, not Decatur
I'm the one they say don't play with
Make them boys get on your tater
High-five LeBron, floor seat the Lakers
Get more paper, get more haters
Standin' still, my diamonds skatin'
Fucked her once, she think we datin'
I can spend it, I been savin'
I'ma spin ya, try to play me
I been trappin' up the millions, used to trap it off a RAZR
Back when I was sellin' two-for-five plays, called in my RAZR
Niggas never had to give it to me, I want it, I'ma take it
Guaranteed to tell a ho goodbye if she don't try to get naked
I'm like room
Mmh, gotta get up out my room
Got some more bad vibes comin' through

Take a sip, drowning in this shit
Coppers on my hip, I hold my head
I've been taking risks to make that money flip, shots to the head
I ain't order it, I can't afford this shit
Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit
Now, it's pay up player, pay a nigga
Gotta day to day to stack and still I pay accounts
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance
Only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, coming down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them wit-it boys stay wit' us
I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan
Looking in the mirror like ""One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man""
One skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker
Young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yah

There's a lot of motherfuckers that can't handle they liquor
Can't handle these drugs

Leave that to them, leave that to us, yeah

Wake up and I'm on, smoke me some weed
Wake up my bitch, ho, get on your knees
Get a taste of this life, drugs, liquor, pills and lean
With one of the realest, trillest mud niggas from the South than you've ever seen
Legendary shit, I'm faded, I'm wasted, I'm still at it
Sleep walkin' through life, it ain't never panic
It's a blue dream that you can't imagine
I've been through some shit that your life couldn't handle
Like runnin' with the mob, I'm blessed
I gotta thank God for the Mafia
I'ma last, I'ma breathe, rob a nigga from the block with me
Flyin' G5, sellin' yachts with me
180 in a 'Rari 'til the squad get me
Hustlers never sleep 'til a box fit me
It's hard to stay sober with them THC
The hustle continues, now vibe with me
The hustle continues, get high with me

Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
**** **** way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the ******* wish it was a noo-

Way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these **** I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the boo-
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, ******* treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that-pop that!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goo-
Who put this sh** together? I'm the glue

Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds
(Alright, alright)
Yeah, this right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spirit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?

Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took *****

Tear the club up, tear the club up (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD & Travis Scott]
The party never ends
In a motel laying with my sins, yeah, yeah
I'm tryna get revenge
You'll be all out of love in the end, yeah
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Bicentennial man, put the city on slam
She get trippy off Xans, lost 21 grams
And she did it on cam, wasn't no video dance
Make my own rules, I really don't pick, I just choose
I don't set picks, I just shoot
Chop and get screwed
I told her it's B.Y.O.B., that mean buy your own boobs
Put it on God, He the one who put me on top
Can't be put in a box, gotta move on the opps
Never got the move on the drop
Niggas tryna move on the Scott
And move that deep, tryna run down, shit's steep
Gotta act a fool with the squad
Next city, no sleep, back to the 713

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Spent ten hours on this flight, man
Told the pilot ain't no flight plans
Can't believe whatever I'm seeing
And they know whenever I land
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Sheck Wes]
The club up, the club up
The club up, the club up
The club up, the club up
The club up, the club up (Yeah)

The party never ends

[Chorus: Sheck Wes & Juice WRLD]
The club up, the club up
The club up, the club up
The club up, the club up
The club up, the club up (Yeah)
The party never ends

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Family function, ain't no friends, had a line around my ends
Turned 'em into Ms, why you tryna make amends?
What's that smell? It's heaven's scent
Like I drop shade out the wind
Dodgin' hell and sins, I can't go back there again
Nah, the dawgs ain't civilized, take the one, feel vilified
You can't see my sons, like the light don't hit they side
In the function and I'm fried, this strive is not a drive
When they open wide, it's a riot, riot

[Outro: Sheck Wes]
The club up, the club up
Nah, nah, for real, we walkin' in this ***** heavy

I could tell that you were from Texas, from Houston specifically
When I read that you refer to yourself as the Owl Pharaoh
Do you know how?
Well, what sound does an owl make?
Mike Jones
Just wondering, what is your favorite drink?
Uhm, snapple fruit punch
Well then, I will say this very convincingly, you're 19, your favorite drink is whatever they serve in the police station because I'm texting the cops right now
Travis, we gon' play a little game called ""Good, Great, The Best"", okay?
Where I'm gonna throw out a term and you say ""good"", ""great"" or ""the best"", okay

Cactus Trails Escape,rap,travis scott,2020,720,"Now, I’m lost, Jacques Berman Webster II, most definitely lost
I see the needle sway and they tell me I’m all I got. This is my name, so, this is who I must be, I should listen. This is just an intro to myself, that much is clear. And if I can go get away from myself, I might find something worth bringing back home, but my problem is that my mind is moving at max speed. The air is moving slower the faster my feet move. My Air Max 270s keep me grounded to this hypothetical floor. I’m hovering at the layer between what’s real and what I made up, which are the same being that much I know. And I should be lost on purpose, intention, made it across the universe like perfect, made you wish rehearsed it because it really does look so perfect. My imagination is a burden that has me lost and uncertain, but what nourishes me is Houston. What’s the difference between being lost and escaping? An attention. What’s the difference between a ladder and an elevator? Labor. Feel free to feel lost, it’s free, there’s no cost. The cacti fell over on the path, that’s how I noticed I can fly. The truth is, your always home. I create a city with no buildings or people, just deep breaths and daydreams, nightmares and ancestors’ energies fly and memory. I can get away, I can make it, whether it’s outdated and I’m Jaded, or I become the air and I made it.

Also to all the freshman in the wrong classroom this ain't 3rd block
All of you nappy headed 'fro havin tru' religion wearin' this ain't Boondocks

LOST FOREVER,rap,travis scott,2022,45502,"[Intro: Chuck Senrick & James Blake]
Lost, have you ever been lost?
Forever
Lost, forever
And how wonderful, how wonderful
Wonderful, how wonderful (Lost)
How wonderful, how wonderful
How you are, forever

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & James Blake]
Lost on islands, driven in boat cars
Just bring your girl, feel like she both ours
Young black nigga work at the Auchans
So how we here trapped on the ocean?
'Bout to go up a level of disrespectful
I'm just one chain away from goin' heavy metal
I'm just one angel away from blockin' out the devil
Just one mountain away from meetin' all my rebels
Too much power, too many hours all in a day
I sent her flowers, ain't talkin roses, I'm talkin' maoda
Ask if she ""Ha-ha-ha"" I really doubt it (Ha-ha-ha)
Took her through the Hills at noon, she felt the... (And how wonderful, how wonderful)
Baby girl think she in Honolu' (Wonderful)
Don't you know you in the I-5 loop? (How wonderful)
How many chickens fit in the coupe? (How wonderful, wonderful)
Wonderful, she don't wanna leave
She jump up, bounce back like trampoline (How you are, forever)
[Verse 2: Westside Gunn, James Blake]
Ayo, whip the cocaine ‘til the pot bust ('Til the pot bust, ah)
You was on the porch, I was locked up (I was locked up, ah)
Two-tone Maybach truck with the Maxwells (Skrrt, Maxwells)
Think a nigga shot somethin' (Ah)
Put it to your face, watch a motherfucker blow (Boo-boo-boo-boo-boom)
Daytona, different color face on the road (Ah)
Ten on his head, he be dead by the mornin' (By the mornin')
I can get dirty for the stove (Ah)
Dior trench shit hang to the floor (Ah)
Dior goggles, I ain't playin' with you hoes (Uh-uh)
I don't sell beach with the poles in the Rolls (Skrrt, boo-boo-boo-boo-boom)
Good to see ya dudes, alligators on the toes (Ah, and how wonderful, wonderful)
Fashion week I'ma strutt too, bitches (Ah, wonderful)
Hundred-round drum, make a nigga go get it (Make a nigga go get it, how wonderful, grrt)
Tribe go to sell a fifth, bucket while we drillin' (How wonderful, how wonderful)

Hope I make it out of here

[Sicko Mode Part I]
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That’s how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don’t know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode

[Sicko Mode Part II]
Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
*Censored* way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I’m back up poppin’ with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin’, man, know the *censored* wish it was a noose
Some—Some—Some—Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl—Pl—Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don’t play us for weak

*Censored* way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these *Censored* I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the *Censored*
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, *Censored* treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pop that!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the *Censored*
Who put this *Censored* together? I'm the glue

Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Pl—Playin' for keeps
Someone said, motherf—someone said
Don't play us for weak
[Stargazing Part II]
Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past, you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before, no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds (Alright, alright, alright)
Yeah, this right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itchin' at my spirit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?

[Goosebumps]
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (Straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (It's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm ridin', why they on me?
Why they on me? I'm flyin', sippin' low-key
I'm sippin' low-key in Onyx, rider, rider
When I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took *Censored*
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't *Censored* with y'all
Yeah, when I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong
Yeah, saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed
Yeah, they gon' pull up on you (Brr, brr, brr)

Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

I'm doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got *Censored* in my room (Ah)

Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)

Hangin' out in them white streets
All black where the hipsters go
Everybody here chokin'
Serious rap, your serious rap's too focused
Ch-Chillin' out while we coolin' out

Big buds, brussel sprouts
Big boobs, let 'em out

Six foot, on the money, I be 6'11"" (Yeah)
Jumpin' out the three, man it's now or never
Never, never goin' home, never, never
What we did was off the record
Just had a deep thought in my cerebellum
Baby, wrist, ridin' round, we gon' take the risk
Ass and tits on 84s, that shit hard to miss
Call Teyana, told her I'ma need a Fade2Fit
I'ma break thе club, bouncer make the mеmbership
On a summer day, don't forget to bring the Haze
I'ma pull up where you stay, at my crib
Where you stay, where we at, no PDA
MMA for the dawgs, better days
[Verese 2: Ic3drop]
Bought a richard Mili touchdown bussdown
Momma asked me why and I said cause i'm rich now
Diamonds dancing on my wrist so bright wow

Custom the things, custom the wings

Cover the back of the lab, front cover magazine
Cover your eyes, cuddled up, back of the V (Yeah)
Our chemistry, just like the trappers and fiends (Ooh)
Our misery really ain't nothin' to see
I gotta travel the V, I like to travel to heat (Ooh)
Bring out a bag of the weed
Did I tell you I got my own weed? I had a lot to achieve
Blew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieve
Rather you leave, then you go back out on me
Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least
You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week
Movin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet
We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah

Like it thick with a bounce, we all in the count
Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave
Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'
Then Mike Brown gon' walk you out (Walk you out)
Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you might've left
I couldn't do none of this by myself
With mafia, they in the tuck
I gave you fifty to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, you'd rather go club
Know what to do, you rattled me up
Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages
Got a couple of vibrations
For the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration

Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy (Yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (Alright)

[Post-Chorus]
I was hot as hell out in the heat (ok ok ok ok)
Then a storm came in and saved my life
Head up to the sky, down on my knees (Straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here (out of nowhere) to save the night
In the nighttime in the nighttime (Woo yeah)

SICKO MODE Radio Edit Version,rap,travis scott,2018,157,"[Part I]

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Notorious B.I.G.]
(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
**** **** way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colorеd chains, think my jeweler rеally sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

[Bridge: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]
Some-Some-Some-Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak
[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this **** way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these **** I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, **** treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that ****!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this **** together? I'm the glue

[Bridge: Travis Scott, Swae Lee & Big Hawk]
Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Play-Playin' for keeps
Someone said, mother****, someone said
Don't play us for weak

[Part II]
[Intro: Travis Scott & Drake]
Yeah!
Astro, yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Drake & Travis Scott]
She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance (Yeah)
Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands
I did half a Xan, thirteen hours 'til I land
Had me out like a light, ayy, yeah
Like a light, ayy, yeah

[Verse 3: Drake & Travis Scott]
Like a light, ayy, slept through the flight, ayy
Knocked for the night, ayy
767, man, this **** got double bedroom, man
I still got scores to settle, man
I crept down the block (Down the block)
Made a right (Yeah, right)
Cut the lights (Yeah, what?), paid the price (Yeah)
**** think it's sweet (Nah, never), it's on sight (Yeah, what?)
Nothin' nice (Yeah), baguettes in my ice (Aw, man)
Jesus Christ (Yeah), checks over stripes (Yeah)
That's what I like (Yeah), that's what we like (Yeah)
Lost my respect, you not a threat
When I shoot my shot, that **** wetty like I'm Sheck
See the shots that I took (Ayy), wet like I'm Book (Ayy)
Wet like I'm Lizzie
I be spinnin' Valley, circle blocks 'til I'm dizzy (Yeah, what?)
Like where is he? (Yeah, what?)
No one seen him (Yeah, yeah)
I'm tryna clean 'em (Yeah)
[Chorus: Drake & Travis Scott]
She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance
Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands (Woo)
I did half a Xan, thirteen hours 'til I land
Had me out like a light (Like a light)
Like a light (Like a light)
Like a light (Like a light)
Like a light

[Verse 4: Travis Scott]
Yeah, passed the dawgs a celly
Sendin' texts, ain't sendin' kites, yeah
He said, ""Keep that on lock""
I say, ""You know this ****, it's stife,"" yeah
It's absolute, yeah (Yeah), I'm back, reboot (It's lit)
LaFerrari to Jamba Juice, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
We back on the road, they jumpin' off, no parachute, yeah
Shorty in the back
She said she workin' on her glutes, yeah (Oh my God)
Ain't by the book, yeah, this how it look, yeah
