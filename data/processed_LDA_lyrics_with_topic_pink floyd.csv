So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
[Outro/Breathe Reprise: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells",en,"ticking away the moments that make up a dull day fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown waiting for someone or something to show you the way tired of lying in the sunshine , staying home to watch the rain you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today and then one day you find ten years have got behind you no one told you when to run , you missed the starting gun   and you run , and you run to catch up with the sun , but it's sinking racing around to come up behind you again the sun is the same in a relative way , but you're older shorter of breath , and one day closer to death every year is getting shorter , never seem to find the time plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way the time is gone , the song is over , thought i'd something more to say  home , home again i like to be here when i can and when i come home cold and tired it's good to warm my bones beside the fire far away across the field the tolling of the iron bell calls the faithful to their knees to hear the softly spoken magic spells","['ticking', 'away', 'moments', 'dull', 'day', 'fritter', 'waste', 'hours', 'offhand', 'way', 'kicking', 'piece', 'ground', 'hometown', 'waiting', 'way', 'tired', 'lying', 'sunshine', 'staying', 'home', 'watch', 'rain', 'young', 'life', 'long', 'time', 'kill', 'today', 'day', 'find', 'years', 'got', 'told', 'run', 'missed', 'starting', 'gun', 'run', 'run', 'catch', 'sun', 'sinking', 'racing', 'come', 'sun', 'relative', 'way', 'older', 'shorter', 'breath', 'day', 'closer', 'death', 'year', 'getting', 'shorter', 'find', 'time', 'plans', 'come', 'naught', 'half', 'page', 'scribbled', 'lines', 'hanging', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'english', 'way', 'time', 'gone', 'song', 'thought', 'home', 'home', 'like', 'come', 'home', 'cold', 'tired', 'good', 'warm', 'bones', 'fire', 'far', 'away', 'field', 'tolling', 'iron', 'bell', 'calls', 'faithful', 'knees', 'hear', 'softly', 'spoken', 'magic', 'spells']",1,Emotional Journey

Is there anyone home?

And get you on your feet again

Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer

Money, get away

Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one knows the wheres or whys

And starts to climb towards the light

By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate

As I reach for a peach, slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez
Breakin’ a stick with a brick on the sand
Ridin’ a wave in the wake of an old sedan
Sleepin’ alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her callin’

Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain, on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
I’m drinking champagne like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I’ll gather my far-flung thoughts together
Speeding away on the wind to a new day

And listen to the things they say

Open a book, take a look at the way things stand

Making a date for later by phone

Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign

And hold on to the dream!

And if I'm in I'll tell you (What's behind the wall)

[Verse 2]
There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?

[Verse 3]
And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?
[Guitar Solo]

Thought I oughta tear the curtain down

Two Suns in the Sunset,rock,pink floyd,1983,37780,"[Verse 1]
In my rear view mirror the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions, confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come

[Verse 2]
The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in
Gives way and suddenly it’s day again
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset, hmph
Could be the human race is run

[Verse 3]
Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck (“Oh no!”)
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear (*Scream*)
And you’ll never hear their voices (""Daddy, Daddy!"")
And you’ll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore
[Verse 4]
And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds,  foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

Standing alone, my senses reel

Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

Condition grounded but determined to try

My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly

Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
""Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away""

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary

From the coldness inside

Sorrow,rock,pink floyd,1987,35083,"[Verse 1]
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

Settle in your seat and dim the lights

Play these strings until my fingers are raw

They threw the locks onto the ground

Like paper doves in flight

No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

As friends and neighbors turn away
And there’s a change that even with regret
Cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey

The music played, the morning sun streamed in

And all but the bitter residues slipped away

Didn’t recognize I’d become
No more than alive; I’d barely survive
In a word, overrun

Won’t hear a sound (He’s curled into the corner)
From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I’ve spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out (…curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)
To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart’s (Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much

I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don’t even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light, I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile

My nervous system all awry
I’m wearing the inside out

He’s paler somehow
But he’s coming around
He’s starting to choke
It’s been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth

And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again

I’m holding out (He’s standing on the threshold)
For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he’ll)
Have blown away (…curse the place)

Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)

We bitch and we fight
Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do
These times together
Rain or shine or stormy weather
This thing we do
With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
Or stay home by the fire, felled by desire
Stoking the flame
But we’re here for the ride

[Hook]
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
[Verse 2]
The strings bend and slide
As the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
Gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
We're more than alive

[Hook]
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
This thing they call soul
Is there with a pulse
Louder than words
Louder than words

Point Me at the Sky,rock,pink floyd,1968,9040,"[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and...

[Pre-Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, ""This is my last goodbye""

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in...

[Pre-Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
People pressing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

Point me at the sky and let it fly

Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

It's time to go, better run and get your bags, it's goodbye
Nobody cry, it's goodbye

A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed
Use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed, he has cried
He has fought, he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best
And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

But no, I have

Country Song,pop,pink floyd,1997,753,"He made his way to the border
In the shadow, under the trees
Down by a stream, in a hollow
Turn your head, feel the breeze

And the Red Queen was waiting for the news
For the White King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

They let him in by a backway
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the White King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round
Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint, take all the white
Make up a newborn colour
Cover your neighbor, we'll be alright

And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no-one showed us to the land
And no-one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries
Now starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can

And no-one calls us to move on
And no-one forces down our eyes
No-one speaks and no-one tries
No-one flies around the sun
Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no-one sings me lullabies
And no-one makes me close my eyes

You’ve Got to be Crazy Live at Wembley 1974,rock,pink floyd,1974,13495,"[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Gotta be crazy, you gotta be mean
Gotta keep your shoes and your car clean
Gotta keep smiling, you gotta keep fit
You gotta keep drinking, you gotta eat shit
You gotta be small to be a big shot
Gotta eat meat to stay at the top
You gotta be trusted, you gotta tell lies
Gotta be able to narrow your eyes
You gotta believe they gotta believe you
Gotta appear easy to see through
Gotta be sure you look good on TV
Gotta resemble a human being
You gotta keep one eye over your shoulder
Gonna get harder as you get older
Gotta fly south and hide in the sand
Gotta forget that you're gonna get cancer

[David Gilmour's scat singing]

[Verse 2: Roger Waters] (David Gilmour Harmonies)
And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down
All alone
Dragged down by the stone
[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
You've gotta be sure, you gotta be quick
Gotta divide the tame from the sick
Gotta keep all of us docile and fit
Gotta keep everyone buying this shit
They gotta get you started early
Processed by the time you're thirty
You work like fuck until you're sixty-five
And time's your own until you die
Gotta admit to a lot of confusion
Pain in the head is the child of collusion
Gotta resist this creeping malaise
Gotta believe in the way you get out of the maze
But you, you just keep on pretending
You can tell a sucker from a friend
But you still raise the knife
Stranger, lover, friend and foe alike

[Verse 4: Roger Waters] (David Gilmour and Rick Wright backup)

Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside

The words have different meanings
Yes they did

Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
Summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade
For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house darkness old perfume
And fairy stories held me high

Blown on the steel breeze

Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

You cried for the moon

And exposed in the light

Rode on the steel breeze

Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes, and jam
And slices of delicious ham

[Hook]
Oh Mother, tell me more

Why’d 'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines

The chief defect of Henry King
Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did

In finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
And summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade

For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

Remember when you were young?
You shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond!

You were caught on the cross fire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright (both)]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright (both)]
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say
[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
Its good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells",en,"ticking away the moments that make up a dull day you fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town waiting for someone or something to show you the way tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today and then one day you find ten years have got behind you no one told you when to run , you missed the starting gun   and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking racing around to come up behind you again the sun is the same in a relative way but you're older shorter of breath and one day closer to death every year is getting shorter , never seem to find the time plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way the time is gone , the song is over thought i'd something more to say  home , home again i like to be here when i can and when i come home cold and tired its good to warm my bones beside the fire far away across the field the tolling of the iron bell calls the faithful to their knees to hear the softly spoken magic spells","['ticking', 'away', 'moments', 'dull', 'day', 'fritter', 'waste', 'hours', 'offhand', 'way', 'kicking', 'piece', 'ground', 'home', 'town', 'waiting', 'way', 'tired', 'lying', 'sunshine', 'staying', 'home', 'watch', 'rain', 'young', 'life', 'long', 'time', 'kill', 'today', 'day', 'find', 'years', 'got', 'told', 'run', 'missed', 'starting', 'gun', 'run', 'run', 'catch', 'sun', 'sinking', 'racing', 'come', 'sun', 'relative', 'way', 'older', 'shorter', 'breath', 'day', 'closer', 'death', 'year', 'getting', 'shorter', 'find', 'time', 'plans', 'come', 'naught', 'half', 'page', 'scribbled', 'lines', 'hanging', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'english', 'way', 'time', 'gone', 'song', 'thought', 'home', 'home', 'like', 'come', 'home', 'cold', 'tired', 'good', 'warm', 'bones', 'fire', 'far', 'away', 'field', 'tolling', 'iron', 'bell', 'calls', 'faithful', 'knees', 'hear', 'softly', 'spoken', 'magic', 'spells']",1,Emotional Journey

This is Radio 1
On medium wave
And this is John Peel with another concert, and this one-
No!
You blew it, you did it all wrong. Anyway, The Pink Floyd!

[Verse 1]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
Last sunlight disappears
Distant bells, new-mown grass smells
So sweet
By the river, holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

[Chorus]
And if you hear, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
A silver sound for a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me
[Verse 2]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Children's laughter in my ears
Last sunlight disappears

[Chorus]
And if you hear, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
A silver sound from a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

A silver sound from a time so strange

[Commentary and ""One of These Days"" Introduction]
And if you had listened to this program a year ago, you would have heard the Floyd do Dave Gilmour's ""Fat Old Sun"" then, but it's changed quite a bit, I think, during the past twelve months

This next one is described by Roger Waters as ""a poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation."" Make what you will of that. During the course of it, too, Nick Mason's vocal debut comes round. And although you'll hear his voice, at no time—if you're here in the studio, of course—at no time will you see his lips move, which is something of a technical tour de force. And it's called ""One of These Days, I'm Going to Cut You into Little Pieces,"" or for the benefit of the LP, ""One of These Days.""",en,"this is radio 1 on medium wave and this is john peel with another concert , and this one- no ! you blew it , you did it all wrong . anyway , the pink floyd !  when that fat old sun in the sky is falling summer evening birds are calling summer sunday and a year last sunlight disappears distant bells , new-mown grass smells so sweet by the river , holding hands roll me up and lay me down  and if you hear , don't make a sound pick your feet up off the ground and if you hear as the warm night falls a silver sound for a time so strange sing to me , sing to me  when that fat old sun in the sky is falling summer evening birds are calling children's laughter in my ears last sunlight disappears  and if you hear , don't make a sound pick your feet up off the ground and if you hear as the warm night falls a silver sound from a time so strange sing to me , sing to me   when that fat old sun in the sky is falling summer evening birds are calling summer sunday and a year the last sunlight disappears  and if you hear , don't make a sound pick your feet up off the ground and if you hear as the warm night falls a silver sound from a time so strange sing to me , sing to me sing to me , sing to me  and if you had listened to this program a year ago , you would have heard the floyd do dave gilmour's ""fat old sun"" then , but it's changed quite a bit , i think , during the past twelve months this next one is described by roger waters as ""a poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation .

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?
[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun




[4:56 - 19:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

And silent replies that swirl invitation

High Hopes Live at Earls Court 1994,rock,pink floyd,1995,1104,"[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

Condition grounded but determined to try

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

Suspended animation, a state of bliss

[Verse 1]
One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran: a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

[Verse 2]
The use of force, he was so tough
She’ll soon submit, she’s had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He’s just the same as all the rest
He’s not the worst, and he’s not the best
[Verse 3]
And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

Dogs of war and men of hate

For hard cash we will lie and deceive
Even our Masters don’t know the webs we weave

Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar

You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Verse 2]
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

And when I come home cold and tired

Showing feelings of an almost human nature

Have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied

Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today

One Slip Live at Nassau Coliseum 1988,rock,pink floyd,1989,154,"[Verse 1]
A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
""I will, I will"" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won’t forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

Learning To Fly Live at Earls Court 1994,rock,pink floyd,1995,444,"[Verse 1]
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that’s learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

Can’t keep my eyes from the circling skies

Just an earth-bound misfit, I

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

Suspended animation, a state of bliss

From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
""Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away""

It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change, did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

Sorrow Live at Knebworth 1990,rock,pink floyd,2019,127,"[Verse 1]
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

Learning to Fly Remix 2019,rock,pink floyd,2019,58,"[Verse 1]
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone as my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tonguе-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

Abovе the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss

The vision of an empty bed

A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word, her honour to defend
""I will, I will"" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate

Hell opened up and put on sale

Even our masters don't know the webs we weave

Hollow laughter in marble halls

Has unleashed thе dogs of war

Signed and sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Well, winners can lose and things can get strained

Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're oldеr
Shorter of breath and one day closеr to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired

On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
""Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away""

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find arе strange
Mesmerizеd as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

Thank you!

[Verse 1]
The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 2]
A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agеnt are both busy on the phone
Sеlling coloured photographs to magazines back home

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me
[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You feel the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

[Chorus]
High time! Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Interruption by French host]
Currently, thanks to electronic network machinery. The sound has a stereophonic effect on it, making it travel back and forth across the Sports hall in front of a very attentive audience, despite some rowdiness...

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Lying supine in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]

You run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say...",en,"ticking away the moments that make up a dull day you fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown waiting for someone or something to show you the way lying supine in the sunshine , staying home to watch the rain you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today and then one day you find ten years have got behind you no one told you when to run , you missed the starting gun   you run , and you run to catch up with the sun , but it's sinking racing around to come up behind you again the sun is the same in a relative way , but you're older shorter of breath , and one day closer to death every year is getting shorter , never seem to find the time plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way the time is gone , the song is over , thought i'd something more to say . . .","['ticking', 'away', 'moments', 'dull', 'day', 'fritter', 'waste', 'hours', 'offhand', 'way', 'kicking', 'piece', 'ground', 'hometown', 'waiting', 'way', 'lying', 'supine', 'sunshine', 'staying', 'home', 'watch', 'rain', 'young', 'life', 'long', 'time', 'kill', 'today', 'day', 'find', 'years', 'got', 'told', 'run', 'missed', 'starting', 'gun', 'run', 'run', 'catch', 'sun', 'sinking', 'racing', 'come', 'sun', 'relative', 'way', 'older', 'shorter', 'breath', 'day', 'closer', 'death', 'year', 'getting', 'shorter', 'find', 'time', 'plans', 'come', 'naught', 'half', 'page', 'scribbled', 'lines', 'hanging', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'english', 'way', 'time', 'gone', 'song', 'thought']",1,Emotional Journey

Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas

Think I'll buy me a football team
