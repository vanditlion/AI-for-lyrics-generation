Put Your Hearts Up,pop,ariana grande,2011,23770,"[Intro]
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

[Verse 1]
Y-Y-Y-You think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking by strangers on the side of the street, like
A quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
[Post-Chorus]
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

[Verse 2]
W-W-W-Wishing on a shooting star in the sky
We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Gandhi, resurrect King
But if we put our heads together, we can do anything, like
You don't have to be a billionaire
You don't have to have much to show how much you care, like
Give a wink, give a kiss, like
Give a little happiness, like-like-like

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
(Maybe we can change the world) I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
(Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls)

[Post-Chorus]
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
[Bridge]
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah (Hey, yeah, yeah)
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
(We can change the world, we can change the world) I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah (Hey, yeah, yeah)
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
(Sing it all you boys and girls)

[Post-Chorus]
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
(We can change the world)

Daydreamin,pop,ariana grande,2013,125117,"[Verse 1]
You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

[Chorus]
So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
[Post-Chorus]
Fo—For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Now I can't wait
To hold you in my arms
I know I was made for you
I'm in love with all your charm

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

I wanna mix a potion up
Make a special drink for you
Mmm-mmm
Just a little sip
And you're never gonna know what hit you, yeah, when I'm through
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I'm not talking 'bout movies
Don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me and stay through thick and thin
I'm just gonna use some magic
Might feel a little drunk
And if you try to leave me, I'll lock you in my trunk

[Chorus]
I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
[Verse 2]
Boy, I really knew you were the one
The moment that I saw your eyes
Mmm-hmm
Strong, and wise, and sweet, and quiet
Yeah, you're just my type
Mmm-hmm

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now I'm not talking 'bout movies
Don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me and be my shiny prince
I'm just gonna use some magic
Might feel a little high
But we'll be so enchanted and you'll feel so alive

I'm gonna witch you

[Verse 1]
I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

[Verse 2]
Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it (Found it)
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)
You're sayin', ""Baby, don't worry""

Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like we've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight

We can find our way home

Suitcase,pop,ariana grande,2010,4608,"I was there in the rain
Crying again
You said that you changed,
But you're just the same

Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes

Don't worry
I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone
(You better be gone)

Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess with true love
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore

Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone

So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone

Higher... uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Been running 'round in circles tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy while chilling with my friends
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

Crazy, what we're doing: living, letting go (Go, go)
Riding, having good times and no one has to know (No, no)

If men are dogs then I guess I be the type to stay
Feelin's grow over time
Diamonds go over time
So we gotta stop playing, no over time

You give me that kinda something
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I’m at 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it, babe

I love the way you make me feel

When you put your lips on mine
And honey it ain’t a question, (quick question)
Cause boy I know just what you like

So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me

Want a jack it like chilly weather
But we ain't worry about nothin' we ain't worry about nothin'
I know you gonna ride like that car parked out front

She walk out when she want
Bought them red bottoms 'cuz she ain't walked out once
And I love the way you make me feel
My thirsty ex get no refill

So don’t you worry, baby you got me

Hold up, wait
Shut up and kiss me, babe
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go

See, what you don't understand
Is falling in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I'll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doing, doing

[Chorus]
Nothing but lovin' you
Nothing but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time
I'm lovin' your loving
I'm lovin', I'm lovin' you, baby

You don't gotta question if I'm really loving your lovin'
I'm lovin', I'm lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my, all my

[Bridge]
Time and my trust
Don't mess this up
You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' so hard
Boy, you change the way I breathe
When you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear to you
That boy, you're all I need
My baby

On a great date, you can hold my hand
But nothing more

Would you do the things that drive me crazy?

I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something

And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Can I, can I, can I please put my hand on it?
Shaking like they're burning, lemme put a fan on it
Bumble bee, got the parachute to land on it
'Cause you got the cake, can I put my candle on it?
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
Got me talking marriage, I like what I see
I'ma put a ring on it, word to Bey and Jay-Z
But before I do that, let me put a hand on it
Oh, so hot I could catch a tan on it
Got me sweating so much, we can swim on the dance floor
We gon' have to mess around and put a dam on it (dam on it)

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
I love the way it feels
Stay back and keep still
Your hands softly (softly)
Please don't take them off
Don’t take them off

So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Born This Way / Express Yourself,pop,ariana grande,2011,2435,"It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M

Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause he made you perfect, babe.""
""So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say.""

[Intro]
Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Chorus 2]
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Refrain]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

[Breakdown]
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down",en,"it doesn't matter if you love him , or capital h-i-m  just put your paws up 'cause you were born this way , baby my mama told me when i was young we are all born superstars she rolled my hair and put my lipstick on in the glass of her boudoir ""there's nothing wrong with loving who you are"" she said , ""'cause he made you perfect , babe .

Rolling in the Deep,pop,ariana grande,2011,1089,"[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your **** bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do (huh)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

Make a home down there

Zero to Hero From Hercules,pop,ariana grande,2015,18310,"[Intro]
Hercules
Hercules

[Verse 1]
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that

[Verse 2]
When he smiled, the girls went wild with (""oohs"" and ""aahs"")
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every ""vahse""
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?
[Verse 3]
Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

[Verse 4]
Who put the glad in gladiator?
(Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre?
(Hercules!)
Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!

[Verse 5]
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-
(Hercules, Hercules)
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, (and the nicest guy)
Not conceited
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero

Winter Things,pop,ariana grande,2015,81893,"[Verse 1]
It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from

My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain

Hey, yo

Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday

When you gave me all them kisses

Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

I got that tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
Ain't nothin' shining more than you, boy

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us

Should've turned to dust

A little too reckless

Yeah, I've been missing you
Where the hell are you
Oh, when I need you?
I could still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back

You said you'd never forget her
And she said she could change your life
It happened on the day you met her
A love at first sight made you blind

[Pre-Chorus]
But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

And all I wanna do is to fall in deep

So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret

Baby, this a microphone checkup
What you getting into when you get up?
When I wake up early, I'ma text ya
Heard you got a man
Baby, I could do it better
And it really ain't the plan
I just want you to remember
How it was, how it is, how it could be
You could pull me in, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, you the sky
Looking up, you a high
You ain't never gotta lie
Cause it's more than just pussy
For the night, everything's alright
When you lay down, I'ma hit the lights
(If you say so)
And what's a life if you don't got me?
Give you what you want, what you need
(What you came for)
Hit me up when you're feeling blue
And I'll tell how I'm feeling too, so you know
I just want to get into you
Right here in the living room
Let's go

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Chorus: Ariana, Elizabeth, Both]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly-y
And so I'm offering this simple phra-ay-ay-ase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

[Verse 2]
Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me, ""If he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him""
He used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Lovin' me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time (Shit)
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (Just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight (Sheesh)
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right?
[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better (Hey)
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better (Boy, if you knew)
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me (Oh)
Ain't nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Ain't nobody like me (Sheesh)
Ain't nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby (Nuh-uh)

Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it, and could you say it again?
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone
(Come on, and ring, ring, ring, yeah)
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid (yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us
And hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
Whatcha you say, boy?

Trying to run game, but I've actually changed (same old)

Yeah
Hey old friends, let's look back on the crazy clothes we wore
And ain't it fun to look back, and to see its all been done  before
All those nights together, our special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow
Just as long as you're dancing next to me 'cause

[Pre-Hook 1 : Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]
It's so clear every year we'll get stronger
What's gone is gone, the past is the past
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas oh

[Hook: Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]
I know we've come so far, but we've got so far to go oh
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long till it's time to go so
Most day we'll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow
I know we've come so far, b-but baby baby
Got so far to go, whoaaah
Oh yeah baby

Hey old friends together
Side-by-side and year by year
The road was filled with twists and turns, but that's the road that got us here
Let's go past the bad times, but before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget and learn from all the mistakes we made 'cause

[Pre-Hook 2]
It's so clear, every year we get stronger (stronger!)
So don't give up, and don't say when
And just get back on the road again 'cause

I know we've come so far, b-but baby baby
Got so far to go, whoaaah
Yeah yeah

[Bridge: All]
Hey old friend come along for the ride
There's plenty of room, so jump inside
The highway's rocky every now and then
But it's so much better than where I've been
Just keep movin' at your own speed
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone
We got so far to go!

[Pre-Hook 3]
It's so clear, every year we get stronger (stronger!)
So shine that light
Take my hand and let's dance into the promise land 'cause

I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

Count to ten, nod your head

Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me

[Verse 1]
You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before
Mmmhmm, like ""I before E, except after C""
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an ""A"" (how to get an ""A"")
Spell ""me"" and ""you"" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

Love The Way You Lie,pop,ariana grande,2010,6289,"[Verse 1]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know
But I really, really doubt you understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'

Not Afraid of Love,pop,ariana grande,2015,3734,"[Verse 1]
I know you want what's best for me
I know you've been waiting patiently
You got my hand over the fire
I know you wanna take me higher

I don't wanna jump until I'm sure
It's not like my heart is insecure
The moment I'm ready
I'll just know it
I'm gonna know it

[Chrous]
Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time and I'll take you there
Oh no, baby, not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there

You make it hard, boy to resist
A little more space
I must insist
Too close
You're intoxicating
Makes me wonder why I'm waiting

I'll give up the fight
When I know it's right
Baby, baby, not tonight
Oh oh, a little more time
And I'll take you there

Or if we're rushing how we feel

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow

Into You / Dangerous Woman Medley,pop,ariana grande,2016,1137,"I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll a dice, hey

Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
(woo, oh, oh, oh)
Before I make a move
(woo, oh, oh, oh)

So, baby, come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more ""touch my body""
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it

I made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

Side To Side Phantoms Remix,pop,ariana grande,2017,883,"[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' (don't think 'bout nothin)
I'm comin' at ya
Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' (don't think 'bout nothin)

Been tryna hide it
Baby, what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Makin' everybody think that we solo

'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me

So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body

This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right

And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

Almost Is Never Enough Soundtrack Version,pop,ariana grande,2013,2977,"[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

I love it, I love it
I love the way, you make me feel

Say, I’m thinking ’bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot

Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I’m at 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

And honey it ain’t a question, (quick question)
Cause boy I know just what you like

So If you need it, I got it, I got it every day
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Uh, I make it feel so fine, I make it feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You’re a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time
Said your bed be feeling lonely, so you’re sleeping in mine
You come and watch a movie with me
“American Beauty” or “Bruce Almighty” that groovy
Just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you, I’m not gon’ get bored of
But baby you’re an adventure so let me come and explore you

Blue eyed, so I fell into submission
Needed to catch myself, like what the hell?

[Verse 1]
Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm
[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm

Ayo, trophy wife, out, you won me
Until you had to find out it's one me
No-no-now you benched, aww, your bum knee
Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li (Ooh)
'Cause you was slippin', yep, you clumsy
And everything I peeped, can't just unsee
Sips tea, and it's unsweet
Re-respect bad gyal when mi done speak (Now, now)
Now he shooting his shot like drive-by
Why-why-why you had to make me go call up my side guy?
Ca-ca-can't let a f-boy eff up my nice vibes
Yo, Ariana, come let me give you a high five

They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
If it ain't your view
That's the bottom line

Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all (Blow it all)

Piano Early Version,pop,ariana grande,2018,583,"I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a fucking battle
Not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (It's not hard)

And I could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was mastered
By love (by love)
It's so hard (So hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

But I'd rather kiss another man who plays the trombone
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a fucking battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

And I could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (It's not hard)
So hard (So hard)
Real hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

That makes you wanna dance

Baby Loves:
[Intro]
Baby loves, I'm tryin' to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
I think I'll rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just now

Knew Better / Forever Boy DWT Version,pop,ariana grande,2017,855,"Part I: Knew Better

[Verse 1]
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I see right through you, boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more, I ain't feelin' you no more)

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby
[Verse 2]
Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me if he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right?

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me...

Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah, boy, they blew it

[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy

So you know what makes me cry
See, you're the one that treat me right

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

​goodnight n go,pop,ariana grande,2018,877128,"[Verse]
Tell me why you gotta look at me that way
You know what it does to me
So baby, what you tryna say? Ayy
Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me? Mmm
I got you, I got you dreamin' (Ahh)
You close your eyes and you're screamin' (Ahh)
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it (Ahh-ah)
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh

One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go

While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips

[Verse 2]
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere
That you can find me
On this train to Paris going nowhere
Draw the bridge behind me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
'Cause tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone
Oh yeah, when you're, when you're gone
Oh yeah, yeah, when you're gone
[Verse 3]
Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, we'll be forever young
Never old, old

[Verse 4]
See upon a ball of fire out in space
Zooming up behind me
All the wondering on your face
Was there inside me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
Tell me who's gonna love me

The Wizard and I Live,pop,ariana grande,2019,14347,"When I meet the Wizard
Once I prove my worth
And when I meet the Wizard
What I've waited for since, since birth
And with all his Wizard wisdom
By my looks, he won't be blinded
Do you think the Wizard is dumb?
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded? No
He'll say to me, ""I see who you truly are
A girl on whom I can rely""
And that's how we'll begin
The Wizard and I

Once I'm with the Wizard
My whole life will change
Cause once you're with the Wizard
No one thinks you're strange
No father is not proud of you
No sister acts ashamed
And all of Oz has to love you
When by the Wizard, you're acclaimed
And this gift or this curse I have inside
Maybe at last, I'll know why
When we are hand in hand
The Wizard and I
One day, he'll say to me
""Elphaba, a girl who is so superior
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
Have a matching exterior?
And since folks here to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on your verdigris
Would it be alright by you
If I de-greenify you?""
And though of course, that's not important to me
""All right, why not?"" I'll reply
Oh, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and I
Yes, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and...

Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy, I know
It sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear, someday there'll be
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do with me

And I'll stand there with the Wizard
Feeling things I've never felt
And though I'd never show it
I'd be so happy, I could melt
And so it will be for the rest of my life
And I'll want nothing else 'til I die
Held in such high esteem
When people see me, they will scream
For half of Oz's favorite team, oh

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you

[Verse 1]
Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I’m sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I’m not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I’m feeling fine
After what I been through, I can’t lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Verse 2]
I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)
And after all that we been through (And after all that we been through)
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)

Must not have had enough money to solve 'em

Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me? Mmm
I got you, I got you dreamin'

Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

I knew you would like this, I must be psychic
I'm from the streets, baby, I'm nothing like them (Tru)
She's sweet in the day, but freaky when night come (Tell 'em)
It's mine, invest it (Uh); I spend it on necklace (Uh)
I got the cash if I don't get credit (Uh)
And I'm well respected so she feel protected
So scratch all the exes (Ex), it's next like contestants (Woo)
It's blessings, no stressing, I'm flexing
Got one car parked right in the entrance
Got one car parked right at the exit
See, you didn't expect this, you think like a robot
I put bands in yo face like Botox

When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet

In My Head Music Video Version,pop,ariana grande,2019,1520,"[Intro: Ariana Grande]
But it was all in my head
Yeah

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Brittany Coney & Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)
[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin' and able

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
Hmm, I thought that you were the one
But it was all in my—
Painted a picture

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
So maybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you, ah

Right There/Youll Never Know/Break Your Heart Right Back,pop,ariana grande,2019,1305,"[Intro: RT]
If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then  put your hands up, put your hands up
If  you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then put your hands up, put your hands up

[Refrain: RT]
You got it, you got it, babe
You  got it, you got it, babe
You  got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe

[Verse: RT]
Okay,  this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?
Boy,  you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine
[Pre-Chorus: RT]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: RT]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (Right there)
Right there (Right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Verse: YNK]
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it’s overkill
So, don’t get mad at me 'cause you’ve been replaced
Know your place
[Pre-Chorus: YNK]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it’d be different
If you spoke, I would’ve listened
But now, I’m with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

[Chorus: YNK]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
Boy, you better tell me, tell me
You’ll never know
Boy, you coulda let me know
You’ll never know
Boy, you could’ve been there for me
But now you’ll never know, you’ll never know

[Verse 1: BYHRB]
I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I’m guessing I wasn't your type, hey
[Pre-Chorus: BYHRB]
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

[Chorus: BYHRB]
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

[Verse 2: BYHRB (Childish Gambino)]
Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal
Don’t understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage, and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause

[Bridge: BYHRB (Childish Gambino)]
Okay, G-A-M-B-I-N-O
I know they hate, but I don’t know why, uh
I know the way he did you was whack
But I know how you can get dude right back and get with me

[Chorus: BYHRB]
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river (Want you to cry me)
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody

It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space

And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'

Knew Better/Forever Boy DWT First Stop Version,pop,ariana grande,2017,181,"Part I: Knew Better

[Verse 1]
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I see right through you‚ boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more‚ I ain't feelin' you no more)

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy‚ you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby‚ if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me‚ baby
[Verse 2]
Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me if he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right?

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me

Never been with a boy more than six months
I couldn't do it, got too used to it
Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah, boy, they blew it

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy

Vienna,pop,ariana grande,2011,435,"Slow down, you crazy child
You're  so ambitious for a juvenile
But  then if you're so smart, then tell me
Why are you still so afraid?

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd  better cool it off before you burn it out
You've  got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day

But  you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you get old
You're gonna kick off before you even
Get halfway through
When  will you realize, Vienna waits for you

Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be
Before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know
You can't always see when you're right. You're right
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through

Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Mmm)
When you're not really there? (Ah, yeah, mmm)

Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Oh yeah, baby, just come on in
Ooh yeah
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Oh, ayy)

Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want

But I ain’t even trippin', I'ma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left

As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

See, you're the one that treat me right

Thank you
Do you mind if we change our costumes real fast?
We got these cute little custom jackets
It's cute?
Alright
What does this even say? It says...
It says ""I want it, I got it""
Huh...
This sounds familiar, huh?
Dublin, does that sound familiar?
Do y'all know this song?
Alright, well, we're gonna need y'all to sing it as loud as you can
Are you ready?
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings, sing
(Write what I sing, yeah) Yuh
[Pre-Chorus]
(My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy)
(Make big deposits, my gloss) Is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it

(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Woo, woo, woo, woo
(You like my hair?) Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I want, yep

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems, what?
(Must not have had enough money to solve 'em)
They say, ""Which one?"" I say (""Nah, I want all of 'em"")
Happiness is the same price as red-bottom, just kidding

[Pre-Chorus]
(My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin')
(The way it shine, I know you've seen it) You've seen it
(I bought a crib just for) Just for (The closet) the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, sing
[Chorus]
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Ooh yeah, yeah
(You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it)
I see it, baby, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
Let's go

Stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops (Surprise, surprise)

So promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That's the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life (Just like that Fenty Beauty kit)

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I (Kiss you)
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be (N-A-S-A)
[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space (I'ma, I'ma need)
You know I'm a star; space (I'ma need space), yeah
(I'ma need space) Sing (I'ma, I'ma need space [N-A-S-A])

I'ma need space (I'ma, I'ma need)
You know I'm a star; space (I'ma need space), yeah
(I'ma need space) Woo (I'ma, I'ma need space [N-A-S-A])

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align
Ah yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I (Kiss you)
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe, New York (N-A-S-A)
[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space (I'ma, I'ma need)
You know I'm a star; space (I'ma need space), yee
(I'ma need space) Sing (I'ma, I'ma need space [N-A-S-A])
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

You know I'm a star (Space, I'ma need space), yeah, baby
(I'ma need space) Yee (I'ma, I'ma need space [N-A-S-A])

Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
Ah yeah
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover

And your love is three times better

Here's the thing
You're in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head
That you are trying to but cannot fix
Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself
I love you, this has gone on way too long
Enough is enough
I'm two blocks away, I'm coming over

Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seein' what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

Fallin', fallin', but I never thought you'd leave me
Fallin', fallin', needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head

Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't buddin'

No matter what I'm wearing, I will always be
India.Arie
When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be, yeah
And I know my creator didn't make no mistakes on me, mmm
My feet, my thighs, my lips, my eyes, I'm loving what I see
Hey, oh woah, baby

[Intro: Aaron Simon Gross & Ariana Grande]
Hi, my name is Kathy Najimy
And this album is for sophisticated consumers of art
Three and a half hours
What I was going to say is
Goodbye for now, the show's over, bye

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say, loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
(Thank you, next [Next])
(Thank you, next [Next])
(Thank you, next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
(Thank you, next [Next])
(Thank you, next [Next])
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)
[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
Said, loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
Look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
No need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
(Thank you, next) Thank you, next
(Thank you, next) Thank you, next
(Thank you, next) Sing
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
(Thank you, next) Said thank you, next

[Post-Chorus]
New York
(Thank you, next)
(Thank you, next)
(I'm so fuckin'—)
[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I wanna shout my mom and dad who are both here tonight
Everybody make some noise for my mom and dad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much (Love) Love
(Got so much patience) Patience
(I've learned from the pain) Hey, yeah
(I turned out amazing) Turned out amazing
(Say I've loved and I've lost) I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
No need for searching
Let's go

​the light is coming Demo,pop,ariana grande,2020,6351,"[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I was the baddest bitch that you ever had
Edition Limited, the Barbie is never mad
I was the baddest bitch that you ever had
My sons, get your dad, 'cause he gon' suffer bad

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, trophy wife, out, you won me
Until you had to find out it's one me
No-now you benched, aww, your bum knee
Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li (Ooh)
'Cause you was slippin', yep, you clumsy
And everything I peeped, can't just unsee
Sips tea, and it's unsweet
Re-respect bad gyal when mi done speak (Now, now)
Now he shooting his shot like drive-by
Why-why-why you had to make me go call up my side guy?
Ca-ca-can't let a f-boy eff up my nice vibes
Yo, Ariana, come let me give you a high five

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead—
The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead—

You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead—

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
What did she say? What did he say?
You don't listen 'cause you know everything
You don't even need dreams
Tellin' everybody, ""Stay woke, don't sleep""

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
Ah, gonna break that shit down
You don't wait, tell 'em wait another round
Ah, guess you're way above it now
And that's your way to love it now

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
If it ain't your view
That's the bottom line
Know-it-all (Know-it-all)
Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all (Blow it all)
As if it were shade, you would just throw it all (Throw it all)
It's like you're trying not to glow at all (Glow at all)
Know-it-all (Know-it-all)

​imagine / My Favorite Things / 7 rings / thank u next Live at the 62nd Grammy Awards,pop,ariana grande,2020,7906,"[Part 1: imagine]

[Verse]
Step up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, ""Skrrt""
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep, ’til noon
So, me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never act this regular

[Pre-Chorus]
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

[Chorus]
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I’m 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world
[Part 2: My Favorite Things]

[Verse]
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Chorus]
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so-oh-oh-ooh

[Part 3: 7 rings]

[Intro]
(Dam-dum, dam-dum, yeah, ah-ah) [Laughter]
(Oh-woah-oh-oh-yeah-ey) (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles (Hmm)
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble (Oh-oh)
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines (Hmm)
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage? (Ah-ah)
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin’
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain’t gon' be no ""Mrs."" (Gon’ be no ""Mrs."")
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches (Oh, yeah)
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches (Riches)
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of ’em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms, yeah-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it
I bought a crib just for the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah
[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it

[Verse 3]
So gen', my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want, baby

[Part 4: thank u, next]

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle, holding hands with my momma
I'll be thanking my dad, 'cause he's really awesome
Only wanna do it once, real bad, gon' make that last
God forbid something happens, least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love, got so much patience
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say, babe

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Said, thank you, next)

Like a fantasy, except it's real
The fairies tell stories of how we laugh
The rainbow's jealous of what we have, except it's real

[Verse 1]
Not to be annoying, not to be annoying
But I wanna keep it going
It's like a epic poem except the letters growing
Punctuate it with the moaning, it's so real

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep me stressed out, stressed out, stressed out, stressed, boy
Stressed out, stressed out
The way you stretch it out, stretched out, stretched out, stretch it
Just stretched out, stretch it out
[Chorus]
And it's unconditional
On top of everything, hey
I cannot make this shit up
On top of everything, it's so real

[Post-Chorus]
Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay

[Refrain]
It's like make-believe
Something that the fans can't see
Like a fantasy, except it's real
The fairies tell stories of how we laugh
The rainbow's jealous of what we have, except it's real
[Verse 2]
Chapter never closin'
It's like a brand new mornin' every moment it's reloadin'
Not sayin' that it's frozen in fact
It is explodin', when your hand and mine are holding, it's so real

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep me stressed out, stressed out, stressed out, stressed, boy
Stressed out, stressed out
The way you stretch it out, stretched out, stretched out, stretch it
Just stretched out, stretch it out

Feeling Christmas all around

""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

So next Christmas I’m not all alone, boy

Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Years Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold

Ari, BIA, oye

[Verse 1: BIA]
I'm out with Ari in Boca Raton
I like my men like my trees, keep me blown
I give you more, you won't leave me alone
But there's things that I need, like my space and my phone
Otra vez, can you feel me?
Can you keep it real? One trilly
See me, do me dirt, real filthy
I'll be on the run 'til we both found guilty
Behind closed doors
I’ma let you see the real me, ya feel me?

[Pre Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I realize ain't no use to
Talkin' 'bout what she won’t do
No, there ain't nothing she won't go through
Come on, boo, we’re talking 'bout you
I never want to ever be the cause of someone else's therapy
But she, won't understand my love for you is past lifelong

[Pre Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Love infinite and it is pure (And it is pure)
Only windows and open doors (And open doors)
No ceilings, there shouldn't be floors (There shouldn't be floors)
If it's what you're getting, that's what I'm for (That's what I'm for)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
More, I'll give you more, more (more)
I'll give you more
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)
[Verse 3: Ariana Grande, Pharrell Williams]
I hate to be on your coattails
This the good stuff you know well
You call me when you're by yourself
Listening to my voicemails
All the hurting you go through
(Wastin' time) cause I know you
Your life could change but it's on you
So what do you say? What you gon' do?

[Pre Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Love infinite and it is pure (And it is pure)
Only windows and open doors (And open doors)
No ceilings, there shouldn't be floors (There shouldn't be floors)

More, I'll give you more, more (more)
I'll give you more
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)

[Verse 4: BIA]
Uh, uh
Tu quieres mas, abre la boca
I flex like you see me doing yoga
I like my money, es mi aroma
Shopping sprees at Neiman's with mi mosa
I'm here to give you much as you can handle
Love is like a game, I'm the one you can gamble
Bet on, bad gals don't get lead on
Girls like these make you dive in, head on, come on

More, I'll give you more, more

I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)

Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
""Excusе me, um, I love you""
I know that's not the way to start a convеrsation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like: ""I love you—who starts a conversation like that?"" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, ""What happened? Why you?""
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 4: Quavo]
Wake up, wake up in my dreams (Wake up)
Feel like paradise between the sheets (The sheets)
Telling me that it belong to me (It belong to me)
Slipping waterfall, it's a dream (Slip, slip)
I keep slipping, I'ma fall in your dream (Slip, slip)
I'm like Sonic, she my Tails, kiss the ring (Kiss the ring)
Don't wake me up at all, I'ma sleep (I'm sleep)

And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin' (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Put it down heavy even though it's lightweight (It's lightweight, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe)
Yeah, we started at midnight

Done at the same time (Yeah)
But who's counting the time when we got it for life? (Got it for life)
I know all your favorite spots (Favorite spots)
We can take it from the top (From the top)
You such a dream come true, true
Make a bitch wanna hit snooze, ooh

Yeah, ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You take me, you take me somewhere that I've never been
I'm ready, I'm ready to place my heart right in your hand
I'm not afraid to give you everything I am
Take me by the hand and lead the way

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm weightless, slow-motion when you're close to me
Your kiss puts me at zero gravity
Fearless, I can close my eyes and just drift away

I'm falling, don't need to learn how to fly
You catch me between the ground and the sky
No worries, I'll just hold onto you
'Cause boy you are my parachute
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You want me, you want me to know I can rely on you
There's no one, there's no one, that takes me up as high as you
And when they see us floating by
They'll know that love is worth a try

You can find me in a crowd
You wait and you never ask ""when?""
While I still figure me out

I get lost inside my decisions and cravings
You seem to pay with your patience
But that’s why I owe you everything

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

All I really care is you wake up in my arms

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so— grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)

Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That— amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah, I've found)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad

Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that— last
God forbid something happens

Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)

I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

I thought you were the one

Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues

Put it down heavy even though it's lightweight (It's lightweight, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe)
Yeah, we started at midnight
Go 'til the sunrise (Sunrise)
Done at the same time (Yeah)
But who's counting the time when we got it for life? (Got it for life)
I know all your favorite spots (Favorite spots)
We can take it from the top (From the top)
You such a dream come true, true
Make a bitch wanna hit snooze, ooh

[Chorus]
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Yeah, yeah)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Can you stay up all night? (Do you know what that means?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Do you know what that means?)

You sweetener,pop,ariana grande,2022,25,"[Verse 1]
Remember when you disappeared? (Yuh)
I couldn't find you anywhere (Yuh)
You went away for such a long time
Such a, such a long time (Yuh; oh, why? Why? Why?)
You used to love me anyway (Yuh)
You used to call me all the, all the time (Yuh)
Pretended like you wasn't my type
Wasn't, wasn't my type, no (Oh, why? Why? Why?)

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know what to say, and you hid it away
Like nobody ever before, yeah
Tried to push it away, but you got me to stay
Boy, I've been trippin', and you been knew
And it's all because you

[Chorus]
Live like there ain't, ain't nothin' bettеr
Taste like, like thе rest of forever
You mine 'til the end of time
It-It has always been you (Yuh)

Even though you always could get it
You mine 'til the end of time

Remember that first December?
All those times I'd sneak over? (Yuh)
It's funny after all of this time
Never thought you'd be mine, no (Oh, why? Why? Why?)

Like nobody ever before, yeah
Tried to push it away, but I'll stay

That bitch is mine,pop,ariana grande,2020,12,"[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I heard you got time on your hands
You been messy, makin' double plans
Make sure before you hit send
Might wanna read that again
Every time you do this, understand

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You're tryna get familiar
With somebody I knew first
She already know her worth
Everything you don't deserve
We already know the truth
Send the screenshots and the proof
You don't even have the juice

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause she, boy, that bitch is mine
(Boy, that bitch is mine, boy, that bitch is mine)
So please, boy, don't wastе no time
Real one on my sidе
[Verse 2: Njomza]
I know you know we know 'bout you
Sorry, we ain't what you normally used to
Prolly think you're comin' closer to me
Don't you think that she'd pick you over me
Boy, please

[Pre-Chorus 2: Njomza]
I got some advice, next time you'll think twice
Bad bitch by my side, always down to ride
We won't let this slack she said you'd get back
Before you come for mine
Boy, make up your mind

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Njomza]
'Cause she, boy, that bitch is mine
(Boy, that bitch is mine, boy, that bitch is mine)
So please, boy, don't waste no time
Real one on my side (That's just crazy)

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Njomza]
Told me hit him after eight o' clock
Told me you'd pick me up at 5
But let me guess, y'all went to ask the neighbors
Reservation at the Chateau (That's just crazy)
You should pull up with me instead
That would really fuck with his head (Fuck)
And he really think that this shit's okay
Won't get away with another thing
[Bridge: Ariana Grande & Njomza]
Ooh-oh, girl, this gon' be some shit
Ooh-oh, girl, we'd love to see it
Ooh-oh, won't get away with another thing
Ooh-oh, so, why don't you lay in this bed tonight?

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Njomza]
'Cause she, boy, that bitch is mine
(Boy, that bitch is mine, boy, that bitch is mine)
So please, boy, don't waste no time
Real one on my side
